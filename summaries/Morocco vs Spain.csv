For the first time in their history, Morocco advanced to the quarter-finals of the World Cup after a penalty shootout victory over Spain. Aguerd had a good chance in the first half, but the game remained scoreless for the majority of the match. Bounou made a crucial save from Olmo in the second half, and Simon denied Cheddira in extra-time. Sarabia hit the post with the last kick of the game, sending it to penalties. Spain were unable to convert any of their three spot-kicks, while Morocco were successful with all four of theirs. Simon saved Benoun's penalty, and Sabiri, Ziyech, and Hakimi all scored to send Regraguiâ€™s side through.
