The Atlas Lions of Morocco can savor their moment of glory! They have fully earned this triumph over a rigid Belgian team. Morocco was steadfast in their defense and scored through Sabiri's free-kick as the Belgians failed to take heed from Ziyech's disallowed goal. The Red Devils were paralyzed, and Aboukhlal took advantage to secure a remarkable victory.
