Portugal advanced to the knockout stages after a 2-0 victory over Uruguay. Fernandes opened the scoring with a curling shot that was meant to be a cross, although Ronaldo attempted to claim it as a header. Uruguay had a few chances to equalize, with Gomez hitting the post, Suarez and De Arrascaete coming close, and Gimenez being called for a handball. Fernandes then converted the penalty kick, and almost completed a hat-trick in stoppage time, but his shot hit the post.
