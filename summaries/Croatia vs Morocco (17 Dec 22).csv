Croatia earned a 2-1 victory over Morocco in the World Cup, securing third place in the tournament. Gvardiol opened the scoring with a diving header in the seventh minute, but Morocco responded quickly with Dari's close-range header. Orsic then put Croatia back in the lead just before half-time with a curling shot off the far post. Morocco had two great opportunities in the second half to take the game to extra time, but Livakovic blocked En-Nesyri's shot and the forward sent a header over the bar in the dying seconds.
