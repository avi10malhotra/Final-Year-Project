Despite coming from behind to defeat Costa Rica, Germany have been eliminated from the World Cup after Havertz scored a brace. Gnabry opened the scoring with a header, but Tejeda equalized with a shot into the bottom corner after Neuer fumbled Wastonâ€™s header. Vargas' flick was then directed into the net by Neuer, giving Costa Rica the lead. However, Havertz responded quickly and put Germany back in front with a shot past Navas, before Fullkrug scored the fourth goal after Sane set him up. Initially disallowed for offside, the goal was eventually given after VAR intervened.
