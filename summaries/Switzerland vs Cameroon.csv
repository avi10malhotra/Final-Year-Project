Switzerland got off to a successful start in Group G with Embolo scoring the only goal of the game. Xhaka initiated the move, sending the ball to Shaqiri who then found Embolo in the box. Unmarked, the striker fired the ball past Onana who had no chance of stopping it. Vargas had a chance to double Switzerland's lead, but Onana was able to push the shot wide. Cameroon had their own opportunities to score in the first half, with Mbeumo and Hongla both having shots on goal that were saved by Sommer.
