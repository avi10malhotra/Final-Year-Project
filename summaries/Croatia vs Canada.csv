Canada scored their first-ever goal in a World Cup match just two minutes into the game, but Croatia was able to come back and win 4-1 at the Khalifa International Stadium. Davies' goal gave the Canucks a brief lead, but Kramaric equalized for Dalic's team shortly after. Livaja's goal just before the end of the first half put Croatia ahead, and two more goals in the second half sealed the victory. Despite their efforts, Canada were unable to get a result and are now eliminated from the tournament.
