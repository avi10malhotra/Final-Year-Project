France have advanced to the semi-finals of the World Cup after a 2-1 victory over England. Tchouameni opened the scoring with a powerful shot into the bottom corner in the 17th minute. England responded well in the second half and were awarded a penalty when Saka was fouled, which Kane converted. Giroud then put France back in front with a header in the 78th minute, but Kane missed a chance to level the score from the penalty spot, sending his effort over the bar.
