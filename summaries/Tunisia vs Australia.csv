Australia earned their first World Cup win since 2010 by defeating Tunisia 1-0. Mitchell Duke scored the decisive goal with a header off of Craig Goodwin's cross. Tunisia attempted to equalize with shots from Youssef Msakni, but the Socceroos' defense, led by Harry Souttar, was able to keep them at bay and secure the victory.
