The Netherlands put on a masterful display to advance to the quarterfinals of Qatar 2022, outplaying a spirited USA team. The Oranje used their experience and the guidance of their renowned coach to take advantage of the USA's inexperience, scoring three times with Dumfries involved in each goal. The first was a classic example of Total Football, and though the USA managed to score a goal in the second half, the Netherlands ultimately earned their place in the quarterfinals.
