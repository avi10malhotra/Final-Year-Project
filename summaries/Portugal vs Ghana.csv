Portugal started their World Cup campaign with a thrilling 3-2 win over Ghana at the 974 Stadium. After a scoreless first half, Cristiano Ronaldo scored the first goal of the tournament with a contentious penalty, becoming the first player to score at five World Cups. Andre Ayew levelled the score for the Black Stars, but Joao Felix and Rafael Leao both scored their first World Cup goals to give the Selecao a two-goal lead. Osman Bukari's close-range header made for a tense finish, and Diogo Costa almost set up Inaki Williams for an equaliser in stoppage time, only for the forward to slip at the crucial moment. Fernando Santos' team held on to secure the three points and get off to a winning start in Group H.
