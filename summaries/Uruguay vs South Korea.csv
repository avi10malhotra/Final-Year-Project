The first 45 minutes of the game were evenly matched, with both teams having their moments. South Korea had the best opportunity in the 34th minute when Ui-Jo was left open in the box, but his shot went over the bar. Uruguay's best chance came just before the break when Godin's header from a corner hit the post. The second half was relatively quiet until the end when Valverde's long-range effort hit the post in the 90th minute and Son shot wide at the other end after a mistake from Rochet. Neither team was able to score, and the game ended in a 0-0 draw.
