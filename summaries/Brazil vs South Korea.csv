Brazil put on an amazing show in the first half, with Vinicius, Neymar, Richarlison and Paqueta all scoring to give them a four-goal lead at the break. They relaxed a bit in the second half, allowing Korea Republic to get a consolation goal from Seung-Ho Paik, but it was too late to make a difference.
