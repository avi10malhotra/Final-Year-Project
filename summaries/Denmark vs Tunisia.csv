At the end of an exciting match, Denmark were denied a penalty in the dying moments. Referee Cesar Arturo Ramos was asked to review the incident on the monitor, but he decided against awarding the spot-kick. Tunisia had the better of the chances in the first half, with Jebali having a goal disallowed for offside and then being denied by Schmeichel. Denmark improved in the second half, with Eriksen having an effort pushed wide and Cornelius missing a great opportunity when he hit the post with the goal gaping.
