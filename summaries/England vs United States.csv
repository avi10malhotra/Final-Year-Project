England and USA have played to a fifth scoreless draw in this World Cup, and it was a match that neither team deserved to win. The Americans put pressure on the English in the first hour, but Southgate's team managed to contain them. Despite their efforts, they were unable to break through the well-structured defense of their opponents, and the game eventually ended without a goal.
