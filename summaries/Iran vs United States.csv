Iran put forth their best effort against the USA, but the Americans had the upper hand in quality and deserved the victory. They were particularly dominant in the first half, scoring their only goal in the 38th minute through Pulisic. Iran improved in the second half, with Rezaeian displaying a lot of skill on the right side, but they were unable to get a shot past Turner.
