Croatia have advanced to the semi-finals of the World Cup for the second consecutive tournament after a 4-2 penalty shootout victory over Brazil following a 1-1 draw in the quarter-final. Neymar had seemingly put the Selecao on the brink of the last four with a stunning goal in the first period of extra time, but Bruno Petkovic equalised with a deflected effort to keep Croatia alive in the second half of extra time. Dominik Livakovic then made a crucial save from Rodrygo Silva's penalty, and Zlatko Dalic's team were perfect in the shootout, with Marquinhos' attempt hitting the post and sending Croatia through and Brazil out of the tournament at the quarter-final stage.
