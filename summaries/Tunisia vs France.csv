Tunisia have made history with their win over France, despite the fact that it was not enough to send them through to the last 16. Wahbi Khazri's goal was the difference between the two sides, and although France pushed hard for an equaliser, VAR denied Antoine Griezmann's effort. This victory will be remembered for a long time in Tunisian football.
