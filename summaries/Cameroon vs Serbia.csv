Aboubakar came in as a substitute and made a huge impact, scoring and assisting in Cameroon's comeback draw with Serbia in a World Cup classic. The game began with Cameroon taking the lead after Mitrovic failed to convert two chances, with Castelletto capitalising on Tolo’s corner. Serbia responded with two goals in first half stoppage time, with Pavlovic heading in Tadic’s free-kick and Milinkovic-Savic curling his effort into the bottom corner. Serbia looked to have secured the win when Mitrovic scored, but Song made a substitution, bringing on Aboubakar. The 30-year-old scored a delicate chip, which was confirmed by VAR, and then set up the equaliser two minutes later, providing Choupo-Moting with an easy finish.
