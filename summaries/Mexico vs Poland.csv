Mexico and Poland ended their World Cup Group C match at Stadium 974 in a scoreless draw. Robert Lewandowski had the best opportunity of the game, but his penalty kick was unsuccessful after he was brought down by Hector Moreno. Neither team was able to generate many chances in the attacking third, and the draw was a fair outcome, giving each side one point in their opening match of the tournament.
