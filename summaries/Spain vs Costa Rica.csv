Despite facing minimal opposition, Spain put on a superb performance in their first game of the 2022 World Cup, scoring seven goals against Costa Rica. Olmo opened the scoring early on, and the Spanish team proceeded to dominate possession and control the match. Costa Rica were unable to get a single shot off, and Spain's young players shone. This sets up an exciting match against Germany this weekend.
