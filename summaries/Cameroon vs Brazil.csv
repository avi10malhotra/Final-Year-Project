Cameroon have pulled off a stunning victory over Brazil, but it ultimately proves to be in vain. Vincent Aboubakar's late header sent the crowd into a frenzy, as Cameroon snatched a win in a match that Brazil had largely been in control of. The Selecao had plenty of chances to score, but their finishing let them down, and Brazil couldn't end their group stage campaign with a win. Despite Switzerland's 3-2 win over Serbia, Brazil will still finish top of Group G, but this result means that Cameroon's World Cup journey is over, as they needed the Swiss to draw or lose in order to progress.
