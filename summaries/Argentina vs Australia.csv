The result was a testament to Argentina’s defensive resilience, as they managed to keep a clean sheet for the first time in the tournament. Led by Otamendi and Foyth, the backline was able to keep the Socceroos at bay for the majority of the game, only conceding in the dying minutes. The midfield trio of De Paul, Paredes and Lo Celso also played a key role in limiting Australia’s chances, as they were able to break up play and keep possession in the middle of the park. Up front, Messi was the star of the show, as he was able to create chances and score the crucial opener.

Argentina will now face either France or Uruguay in the quarter-finals, and will be hoping to replicate their performance against Australia in order to progress further in the tournament.
Argentina are in complete control now and will be looking to add to their lead before the half-time whistle.
1-0 Argentina!
