Argentina cruised to the World Cup final with a decisive two-goal lead in the first half. Messi's brilliance in the second half allowed Alvarez to score again, and the Albiceleste will be in the final for the first time since 2010. Despite Modric's best efforts, Croatia's valiant run to the semi-finals was not enough, and they will now compete for third place on the weekend.
