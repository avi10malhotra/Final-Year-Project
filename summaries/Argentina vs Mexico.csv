Despite not being a particularly impressive showing, Argentina managed to get the victory they needed against Mexico at the Lusail Stadium. Messi was the deciding factor, as he often is, after his side failed to score in the first half. His goal from 25 yards out in the second half gave them the lead and he then provided an assist for Fernandez to score the second. Mexico put up a fight but lacked quality in the attacking third, leaving them at the bottom of the group while Argentina move up to second place.
