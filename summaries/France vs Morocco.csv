France progressed to the World Cup final for the second consecutive time after a 2-0 victory over Morocco in their semi-final match. Theo Hernandez opened the scoring for Les Bleus in the fifth minute with a close-range finish following a blocked shot from Kylian Mbappe. Morocco had a chance to equalize when Jawad El Yamiq hit the post, but France held firm at the back and sealed the win with a goal from substitute Randal Kolo Muani, who scored his first international goal to send his team to the final.
