Portugal have advanced to the World Cup quarter-finals in spectacular fashion, dominating Switzerland in Lusail. Sergio Ramos' hat-trick will be the talk of the town, but it was a collective effort from the Portuguese that earned them the victory. Manager Fernando Santos made all the right moves, and the Swiss were out of the game by the end of the first half.
