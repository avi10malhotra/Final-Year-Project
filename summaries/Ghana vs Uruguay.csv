Despite Uruguay's 2-0 victory, both Uruguay and Ghana have been eliminated from the World Cup. Andre Ayew had the opportunity to give Ghana the lead with a penalty kick, but his shot was saved. De Arrascaeta then scored two goals in six minutes, putting Uruguay in a strong position to advance to the next round. However, South Korea's late goal in the other game resulted in Uruguay's elimination. VAR denied Uruguay a penalty, and despite their efforts, neither team was able to score in the extra time.
