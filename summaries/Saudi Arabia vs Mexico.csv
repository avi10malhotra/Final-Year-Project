Mexico's dreams of advancing to the next round of the World Cup were dashed despite a 2-1 victory over Saudi Arabia. Mexico dominated the match from the start and were rewarded with a goal two minutes into the second half when Martin scored from close range. Chavez then added to their lead with an incredible long-range free-kick. Despite needing a third goal to overtake Poland in the standings, Lozano and Antuna both had goals disallowed for offsides before Al Dawsari put an end to their hopes with a late consolation goal for Saudi Arabia.
