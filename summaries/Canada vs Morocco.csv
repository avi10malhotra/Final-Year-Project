Morocco have secured their place in the knockout phase of the World Cup for the first time since 1986, after winning their second consecutive game at Qatar 2022. Despite being pushed back by a stronger Canada side in the second half, the Atlas Lions held firm and topped their group, becoming the second African nation to progress. They will now face a team from Group E, possibly Spain or Germany, and their determined attitude could make them a formidable opponent.
