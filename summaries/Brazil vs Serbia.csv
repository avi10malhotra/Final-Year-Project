After failing to capitalize on several opportunities in the first half, Brazil came out strong after the break and kept Serbia on the defensive. Richarlison opened the scoring in the 62nd minute, taking advantage of the ball that Vanja Milinkovic-Savic had parried and smashing it into the goal. Richarlison then scored again in the 73rd minute with an impressive acrobatic volley to seal the victory. Serbia were unable to mount any serious offensive pressure, leaving Brazil's defense untested.
