Costa Rica, who had been defeated by Spain in their first match, pulled off a stunning upset by beating Japan, the team that had previously defeated Germany. After a strong defensive performance, Los Ticos took advantage of Japan's ineffective attack to withstand the pressure in the second half and score the winning goal late in the match. Fuller's goal in the 81st minute put Costa Rica on the same number of points as both Japan and Group E leaders Spain, even though they had only qualified for the tournament after winning a playoff against New Zealand.
