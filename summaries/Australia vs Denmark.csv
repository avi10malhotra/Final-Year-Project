Denmark dominated the first half, but there was little action in either penalty area. Ryan was forced to make a save when Souttar inadvertently directed Maehle's cross towards his own goal, but the goalkeeper was able to stop it with his feet. Australia had three shots on target in the first period, but all were easily saved by Schmeichel. The Socceroos began the second half strongly and were rewarded when Leckie scored the winning goal in the 60th minute. He ran 40 yards before nutmegging Maehle and finding the bottom right corner of the net. Denmark were unable to create any chances in the second half and Australia won 1-0 to advance to the knockout stages.
