Poland earned three points to put themselves in a strong position to advance to the Round of 16 before the last game of the group stage. Saudi Arabia put up a good fight, but goals from Zielinski and Lewandowski were the difference-makers, as was Al Dawsari's missed penalty. They put in a solid performance.
