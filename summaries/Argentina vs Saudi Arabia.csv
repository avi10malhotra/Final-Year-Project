In the 10th minute, Argentina was awarded a penalty after the referee saw a foul on Paredes on the VAR monitor. Messi then converted the spot kick, sending it past Al Owais who had dived the wrong way. However, the South American team had three further goals disallowed for offside in the first half. Saudi Arabia was unable to get a shot off in the first 45 minutes, but they managed to score with both of their shots on target in the second half. Al Shehri equalised in the 48th minute after the ball deflected off Romero, and Al Dawsari put Saudi Arabia in the lead with a curling shot. Al Owais made five saves in the game, while substitute Al Amri cleared the ball off the line in the 92nd minute to secure a 2-1 win for his side.
