GOOOOAAAALLLL!!!! Estupinan makes the most of his opportunity, firing a low shot from the edge of the box that the keeper parries, but Valencia is there to make sure it counts this time, equalizing the score at 1-1. After being denied a goal at the end of the first half, Ake plays Valencia onside and they get the goal they deserve to start the second!
