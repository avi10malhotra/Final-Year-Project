Senegal earned their first victory of the 2022 World Cup with a 3-1 triumph over Qatar. Dia capitalized on Khoukhi's mistake to score just before the half-time whistle, and Diedhiou doubled their lead with a header from a corner three minutes after the break. Qatar did manage to get on the scoresheet when Muntari headed in a goal, but Dieng sealed the win late on with a first-time strike.
