Brazil have managed to secure their place in the last 16 after a hard-fought win. Casemiro's goal in the 83rd minute was the difference between the two sides, after Vinicius' earlier effort was disallowed for offside. Switzerland put up a good fight, but Brazil's superior quality in the attacking third eventually paid off. The Selecao are now through to the knockout stages, while Switzerland will need to beat Serbia in their last game to join them.
