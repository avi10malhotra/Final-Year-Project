England began their World Cup journey with a resounding 6-2 victory over Iran. At the half-time whistle, the Three Lions had already established a 3-0 lead, with Bellingham netting his first England goal, followed by Saka and Sterling. Saka scored his second shortly after the hour mark, but Taremi responded with a goal off the underside of the bar. Substitutes Rashford and Grealish then sealed the win, with Rashford scoring just 49 seconds after coming on. The game was completed with a late penalty from Taremi, after a foul by Stones.
