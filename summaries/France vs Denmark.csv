Mbappe's goal late in the match secured the victory for France, who had a 2-1 win over Denmark at Stadium 974. After a first half that lacked finishing, both teams came alive in the second half, with Mbappe connecting with Hernandez to score the opener. Denmark responded shortly after, with Eriksen's corner finding Andersen, who set up Christensen to equalise. However, four minutes from time, Griezmann's cross was met by Mbappe to give France the win and secure their place in the knockout stages. Denmark must now beat Australia in their final match to progress.
