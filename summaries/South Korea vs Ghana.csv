At the beginning of the game, South Korea seemed to be the more likely team to score, but Salisu changed that in the 24th minute when he put Ghana ahead. Jordan Ayew had sent in a threatening free-kick into the six-yard box and South Korea failed to clear it, allowing Salisu to take advantage and score. Kudus then added to the lead with a header off of another Ayew cross. South Korea attempted a comeback in the second half with two headers from Cho, but Kudus responded with his own brace to put Ghana ahead again. Despite South Korea's efforts to get a third goal, Ghana held on for the 3-2 victory.
