Can you believe it?! Itakura's long ball from a free-kick in his own half is met by Asano, who takes a perfect first touch and sprints into the box. He then unleashes a shot from a difficult angle, which beats Neuer and finds the back of the net! What a turnaround, what a story, and what a goal to put Japan 2-1 up!!! GOOOOOOAAAAALLLL!!!!
