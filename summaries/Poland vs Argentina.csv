The match at Stadium 974 is finished, and Argentina have advanced to the knockout stage! The South Americans completely dominated Poland, with Mac Allister and Alvarez scoring the goals. Argentina could have had even more, as Messi had a penalty saved in the first half. Poland is undoubtedly relieved that they didn't concede any more.
