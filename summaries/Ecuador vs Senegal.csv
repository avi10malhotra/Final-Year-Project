Senegal advanced to the elimination round for the first time since 2002 after a 2-1 victory over Ecuador. Sarr earned a penalty kick when Hincapie collided with him, and he confidently put it in the back of the net. Ecuador attempted to come back in the second half, and Caicedo scored from a corner to tie the game. However, only two and a half minutes later, Senegal regained the lead when Idrissa Gueye's free-kick was deflected to Koulibaly, who volleyed in the winning goal.
