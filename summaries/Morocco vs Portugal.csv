Morocco made history as they became the first African team to reach the World Cup semi-finals, after a hard-fought victory over Portugal in Al Thumama. The Atlas Lions put on a defensive masterclass, and En-Nesyri's header in the first half sealed the deal. Despite having to contend with several injuries, they were cheered on by their passionate fans, and having eliminated Belgium, Spain, and now Portugal, they will face either England or France in the semi-finals.
