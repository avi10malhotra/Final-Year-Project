Ecuador earned a 2-0 win against Qatar in the opening match of the 2022 World Cup at the Al Bayt Stadium. Enner Valencia had a header disallowed for offside by VAR in the third minute, but he soon made up for it by scoring from the penalty spot after being fouled by Saad Al Sheeb. Valencia then doubled his side's lead with a powerful header from Angel Preciado's cross. Qatar had a chance to get back into the game before halftime, but Almoez Ali's header went wide. Ecuador held on in the second half to secure the win and three points in Group A.
