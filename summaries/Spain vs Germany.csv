The game ended in a tie, with both teams getting a share of the points. Spain had taken the lead in the second half through Morata, but Germany's Fullkrug equalised in the last 10 minutes. The result was a fair one, keeping Germany in contention for the final game of the group phase. Spain are still at the top of Group E, but they have yet to secure their spot in the Round of 16.
