Both teams began the match with a lot of energy, but as time went on, Croatia began to take control of the game and slow the pace. Perisic had Croatia's best chance of the half, but Gonda was able to deny him from close range after a mistake from Tomiyasu. Japan gained some momentum towards the end of the half and Maeda capitalized on it, scoring his first goal of the tournament off of Yoshida's knockdown in the 43rd minute. The only highlight of the second half was Perisic's equalizer, as his powerful header could not be stopped by Gonda. Extra time was relatively quiet, with the only chance being a deflected effort from Mitoma. In the penalty shootout, Livakovic was the hero, saving three of the four Japan penalties, with only Asano scoring. Pasalic then dispatched the winning penalty, giving Croatia the 3-1 victory in the shootout.
