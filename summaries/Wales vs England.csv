England put on a great show today, easily advancing to the next round of the tournament. Rashford scored two goals and Foden added another, leading the Three Lions to victory against Wales, who put in a lackluster performance. This may be the end of Wales' successful period, while England move on to the round of 16 as the top team in Group B.
