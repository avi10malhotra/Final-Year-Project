Portugal got off to a quick start after Horta scored in his World Cup debut in the first five minutes. South Korea responded twenty minutes later when Kim Young-gwon capitalized on a mistake from Ronaldo. The first half was slow-paced with both teams being cautious in their build-up play. Portugal had the upper hand, forcing Kim Seung-gyu to make five saves. The second half was relatively quiet until Son Heung-min broke away and Hwang Hee-chan scored the winning goal in the 91st minute, sending South Korea to the knockout rounds.
