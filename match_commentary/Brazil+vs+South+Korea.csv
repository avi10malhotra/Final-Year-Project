INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	Brazil scored four goals in a knockout round game at the World Cup for the first time since 1998 (4-1 vs Chile), scoring more goals in the opening 36 minutes of this match (4) than they did in their three group stage games combined (3).	2	Korea Republic are winless in all seven of their World Cup games against South American sides (D2 L5) – only Scotland (8) have faced such nations more often without ever winning in the competition.	3	Neymar became just the third Brazilian to score in at least three editions of the World Cup (2014, 2018, 2022), along with Pelé (1958, 1962, 1966, 1970) and Ronaldo (1998, 2002, 2006).
COMMENTARY	Post Match	Quite an incredible performance from Brazil. An absolutely dominant first half put the game to bed by the half-time whistle - goals from Vinicius, Neymar, Richarlison and Paqueta ensured that they had the cushion of a four-goal lead heading into the interval. They took their foot off the gas in the second half and Korea Republic even managed to score a consolation goal through Seung-Ho Paik. But it was too little, too late.

COMMENTARY	Half-time	Brazil are 4-0 up at half-time. They've produced the most exhilarating performance of Qatar 2022 in this first half, playing with a swagger and arrogance that's typically Brazilian. Vinicius opened the scoring before Neymar (from the penalty spot), Richarlison and Paqueta contributed goals of their own. Given the way Brazil - and Korea Republic - are playing, this could get ugly in the second half.
COMMENTARY	45'	CHANCE! Paqueta, played in by Raphinha, draws a fine save from Kim Seung Gyu - although the Brazilian really should have done better.
