INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	Brazil have finished top of their first round group for the 16th time at the World Cup, four more times than any other side (Germany, 12). They have topped their first round group at 11 consecutive tournaments since 1982. 	2	Despite victory in this match, Cameroon have been eliminated from the group stage in their last six appearances at the World Cup – they last reached the knockout stages in 1990. 	3	Cameroon are the first African team to beat Brazil at the World Cup – African teams had lost all seven previous matches against Brazil, conceding 20 goals. 
COMMENTARY	Post Match	It's all over, as Cameroon seal a famous win over Brazil that ultimately comes in vain. Vincent Aboubakar's late header caused pandemonium, as Cameroon snatched a win in a game which was largely dominated by Brazil. The Selecao peppered Epassy's goal at times, but their finishing let them down, and Brazil couldn't finish their group stage campaign with a flourish. They'll still top Group G though, despite Switzerland's 3-2 win over Serbia, but that result spells the end of Cameroon's tournament, who needed the Swiss to draw or lose in order to progress at their expense.
COMMENTARY	90+7'	SAVED!!! Marquinhos overlaps down the left to link up with Martinelli, and crosses into the box. Guimaraes meets it with a good header back across goal, but Epassy does well to stop and hold it!
RED CARD	90+3'	Vincent Aboubakar	Cameroon · Striker #10	Aboubakar's joy saw him take his shirt off as he celebrated, but as he'd already been booked, picks up a second yellow card and is sent off!
INSIGHTS	90+2'	Vincent Aboubakar is only the third African player to score against Brazil in the FIFA World Cup, after Didier Drogba (2010) and Joel Matip (2014).

Ngom Mbekeli bursts down the right wing and fires an absolute peach of a cross into the box, and Aboubakar ghosts between the two centre-backs to notch a lovely cushioned header beyond Ederson and into the bottom corner!!! Cameroon lead 1-0, and if Serbia can equalise against Switzerland, they will go through to the last 16!
COMMENTARY	89'	OVER!!! Alves finds Raphinha in the box, who passes to Pedro in space. He's in far more open space than he thinks he is, as he quickly turns and fires a snap-shot well wide of the target!
SUBSTITUTION	86'	IN	Jerome Ngom Mbekeli	Cameroon · Midfielder #2	OUT	Moumi Ngamaleu	Cameroon · Midfielder #6	Ngamaleu's flick will be his last contribution, as the Cameroon winger comes off for Jerome Ngom Mbekeli.
YELLOW CARD	85'	Bruno Guimarães	Brazil · Midfielder #17	Brazil's corner comes to nothing and Ngamaleu flicks the ball over Guimaraes' head as he looks to spark a counter-attack. He's dragged back by the Brazil substitute though, and Guimaraes receives a booking for the needless foul.
COMMENTARY	84'	CHANCE!!! Raphinha darts down the right and beats two before crossing from the byline. Guimaraes arrives, but Wooh gets the crucial touch to skew the ball away for a corner!
YELLOW CARD	81'	Vincent Aboubakar	Cameroon · Striker #10	Another corner is cleared, and Martinelli races away on the counter for Brazil. Aboubakar chases hard, but knows he can't keep pace with the Arsenal wideman so brings him down with a rugby-esque tackle, conceding a free-kick and picking up a yellow card to boot!
COMMENTARY	80'	BLOCKED!!! After a Cameroon corner is half-cleared, Aboubakar picks up the ball on the edge of the box. He looks to curl a shot into the top corner, but an Alves block sends it behind for another corner!

SUBSTITUTION	68'	IN	Olivier Ntcham	Cameroon · Midfielder #22	OUT	Pierre Kunde	Cameroon · Midfielder #15	The booked Kunde is next off for Cameroon, and Swansea midfielder Olivier Ntcham will replace him.
SUBSTITUTION	64'	IN	Pedro	Brazil · Striker #25	OUT	Gabriel Jesus	Brazil · Striker #18	Jesus hasn't had the threat in front of goal that his fellow forwards have possessed, and comes off now for Flamengo striker Pedro to see out the game.
SUBSTITUTION	64'	IN	Karl Toko Ekambi	Cameroon · Striker #12	OUT	Bryan Mbeumo	Cameroon · Midfielder #20	Mbeumo comes off in Cameroon's first change, and Lyon forward Karl Toko-Ekambi will replace him.

INSIGHTS	58'	Devis Epassy has equalled the highest amount of saves made by a Cameroon goalkeeper in a World Cup game (since 1966).
COMMENTARY	58'	SAVED!!! Brazil take a quick free-kick and Guimaraes races forward before switching play to the right. Antony has it, and shoots from the edge of the box, with Epassy diving across to tip his effort wide of the post!
COMMENTARY	57'	OFF THE POST!!! The initial corner is headed away, but Ribiero returns down the right-hand byline before pulling the ball back to Militao. He takes a touch before shooting, and Epassy spills the shot before tipping the rebound from Militao onto the post and out!
COMMENTARY	56'	SAVED!!! Brazil counter at speed and the ball comes to Martinelli surging down the left. He heads for the box and engages his marker, before firing a good effort which is tipped over by the goalkeeper at full stretch!

SUBSTITUTION	54'	IN	Marquinhos	Brazil · Defender #4	OUT	Alex Telles	Brazil · Defender #16	Alex Telles can't shake off his injury and trudges off the pitch, with Marquinhos coming on to replace him for the Selecao.
COMMENTARY	53'	CHANCE!! Jesus controls a long ball well to link up with Rodrygo. He gives it back to the Arsenal striker, who snatches at a shot on the turn, and the ball bobbles everywhere via a series of deflections before Epassy eventually gathers it!
COMMENTARY	51'	WIDE!!! Anguissa's cross from the left byline is aimed towards Aboubakar, who is beaten in the air by Militao. The ball drops to Mbeumo, who again finds Aboubakar on the right-hand side, and his well-struck effort flies across the face of goal and wide of the far post!
INSIGHTS	Half-time	Brazil have failed to score a goal in the first half of their last five World Cup matches, with their last seven goals in the competition all coming after the interval.
INSIGHTS	Half-time	Gabriel Martinelli completed three dribbles in the opening 45 minutes, which is more than any Brazilian player has managed in a full game so far at the tournament.
INSIGHTS	Half-time	Brazil had 68% possession in the opening 45 minutes - more than they managed in the first halves of their clashes with Serbia (43%) and Switzerland (39%).
COMMENTARY	Half-time	The first-half ends, with no goals scored but a handful of chances at both ends! It looked likely to be one-way traffic early on, as constant runs in behind by the Brazilians saw Cameroon pick up three booking within the first half hour. Since then though, the Indomitable Lions have improved their discipline, and despite Martinelli and Rodrygo both testing Epassy in goal, have defended well. They almost had a goal of their own too, with Mbeumo's late header brilliantly stopped by Ederson, as Brazil were forced into making their first save of the entire tournament!
COMMENTARY	45+3'	SAVED!!! What a stop from Ederson!!! Ngamaleu crosses from the left and Mbeumo heads back across goal, and the first shot on target Brazil have conceded all World Cup is tipped away by the goalkeeper!
COMMENTARY	45+2'	WIDE!!! Antony plays the corner low into the box, and Rodrygo races to the front post to curl a shot towards goal, but finds only the side netting!
COMMENTARY	45+1'	SAVED!!! Martinelli cuts inside once again, beating three on the edge of the box before smashing an effort goalwards, which is tipped over by Epassy, who was planted to the spot!
INSIGHTS	40'	Brazil have attempted seven shots, more than they managed in the first halves of their games against Switzerland (6) and Serbia (4).
COMMENTARY	38'	SAVED!!! Martinelli drifts in-field and surges through midfield. He's brought down, but Fred picks up the ball and the referee plays advantage. Fred feeds Antony, and the Manchester United winger cuts inside before firing a low shot which Epassy gets down well to hold!
INSIGHTS	34+3'	Bryan Mbeumo's effort was the first shot on target that Brazil have faced at the 2022 World Cup.
COMMENTARY	34'	OVER!!! Dani Alves steps up, and the right-back almost marks his 125th Brazil cap with a goal, but sends a floating shot over both the wall and the crossbar!
YELLOW CARD	32'	Collins Fai	Cameroon · Defender #19	Rodrygo bursts into space once more and darts towards the box, but he's brought down right on the edge, this time by Fai, who is also booked as Brazil prepare another free-kick within shooting range.
YELLOW CARD	28'	Pierre Kunde	Cameroon · Midfielder #15	Rodrygo turns his marker on halfway and sets off for goal, slaloming through the defence before being brought down for behind by Kunde, who concedes a free-kick right on the edge of his own box, as well as picking up a yellow card!
COMMENTARY	25'	CHANCE!!! Martinelli bursts past Fai down the left and races into the area. He cuts the ball back for Jesus, but his first-time shot is blocked by Ebosse!
COMMENTARY	22'	Martinelli passes back to Telles, who whips in a first-time cross. Jesus can't control it, but Fred can, who brings the ball down and fires a volley on the turn which flies over the crossbar!
COMMENTARY	20'	SAVED!!! Back come Cameroon as Choupo-Moting frees up Tolo to burst down the left. He whips in a wicked cross for Aboubakar in the centre, but Ederson dives across to parry the ball away from the goalmouth!
COMMENTARY	20'	CHANCE!!! Choupo-Moting drives forward and beats three defenders on his way into the box. He turns and looks to shoot, but Militao recovers to hook it away for Brazil!
COMMENTARY	14'	SAVED!!! Fred floats a cross into the sparsely populated Cameroon box, and Martinelli arrives to head goalwards from the far post. It's a great header, and the effort is heading in, but it's tipped over the bar thanks to a great save from Epassy!
YELLOW CARD	7'	Éder Militão	Brazil · Defender #14	A poor pass forward from Militao is cut out by Anguissa, and Ngamaleu latches onto the ball. He's barrelled over by Militao, and the Brazil defender picks up his side's first booking of the match.
YELLOW CARD	6'	Nouhou Tolo	Cameroon · Defender #25	Antony again looks to race into space down the right, but he's hacked down from behind in a wild challenge by Tolo, who picks up an early yellow card for his troubles.
COMMENTARY	2'	CHANCE!!! Antony beats his man before releasing Rodrygo down the right-hand touchline. He sprints to the byline and cuts the ball back, where Fred arrives late and slides a shot towards goal, but it's blocked and Cameroon clear!
INSIGHTS	0'	Cameroon have been shown three yellow cards, which is already more than they received against both Serbia (2) and Switzerland (1).
INSIGHTS	0'	Cameroon captain Vincent Aboubakar has had the fewest touches of any player in the match so far (7).
INSIGHTS	0'	Brazil made nine changes to their starting XI for this match, their most between games at a single World Cup since 1966 against Portugal.
INSIGHTS	0'	Aged 39 years and 210 days, Dani Alves became Brazil’s oldest player in a World Cup match. Despite fielding Alves in their starting XI, Brazil named their youngest line-up (27 years, 101 days) since the 2002 final against Germany (26 years, 236 days).
INSIGHTS	0'	Brazil's nine changes is their most between games at a single World Cup since 1966 (vs Portugal after Hungary - also 9).
INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	Brazil have won five of their six meetings with Cameroon in all competitions (L1), most recently a 1-0 friendly win in November 2018. Brazil have won both previous FIFA World Cup games between the sides, 3-0 in 1994 and 4-1 in 2014.	2	Cameroon’s first ever FIFA World Cup game (Peru in 1982) and first ever FIFA World Cup victory (Argentina in 1990) came against South American opponents. Overall they’ve won two, drawn two and lost two of their World Cup games against such sides, with both defeats coming against Brazil.	3	Brazil have won all seven of their FIFA World Cup matches against African sides, scoring 20 goals and conceding just twice.	4	A defeat or draw for Cameroon will see them eliminated from the group stages of the World Cup in their sixth successive appearance at the finals, last reaching the knockout rounds in 1990. They've never won their final group stage game in seven previous appearances at the World Cup (D2 L5).	5	Brazil are yet to face a single shot on target at the 2022 World Cup, the first team to not face a shot on target in their first two games at a tournament since France in 1998. The fewest shots on target faced by a team in a group stage since 1966 is two by Argentina in 1998.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Already through to the knockout stages, Tite makes a whopping nine changes to a Brazil side still oozing with quality. An exciting front three of Antony, Gabriel Jesus and Gabriel Martinelli will cause Cameroon plenty of problems, while at the back, 39-year-old captain Dani Alves captains the side from the right, pushing Eder Militao into central defence. He and Fred are the only two to keep their places from the 1-0 win over Switzerland.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Cameroon bring in plenty of attacking talent in this final game, with Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting and captain Vincent Aboubakar both starting after their respective quick-fire goals saved the game against Serbia. Bryan Mbeumo will provide plenty of ammunition from the right flank, while Frank Anguissa comes into the base of midfield.
