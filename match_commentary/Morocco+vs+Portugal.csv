INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	Morocco became the first African team to qualify for the semi-final of a World Cup tournament. Indeed, each of the previous three African sides to reach a quarter-final were all eliminated at this stage: Cameroon in 1990, Senegal in 2002 and Ghana in 2010.	2	Portugal have been eliminated from a World Cup quarter-final match for the first time in their history, having previously progressed from their two other matches at this stage (5-3 v DPR Korea in 1966 and 3-1 in a penalty shootout v England in 2006).	3	Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo has failed to score in all eight of his knockout stage appearances at the World Cup (inc. third place play-off), going 570 minutes without scoring and taking 27 shots in the process.
COMMENTARY	Post Match	History is written, as Morocco become Africa's first World Cup semi-finalists by bravely beating Portugal in Al Thumama. Defending relentlessly and exhibiting great skill on the break, the Atlas Lions roar into the final four thanks to En-Nesyri's magnificent first-half header. Even with several injuries to contend with, they delight their hordes of noisy fans, and having eliminated Belgium, Spain and now Portugal, a high-stakes clash with England or France awaits.

INSIGHTS	90+8'	Morocco have won their last three World Cup matches when ahead at half time, including a 3-1 victory against Portugal in 1986.
COMMENTARY	90+6'	SAVE! Costa keeps Portugal in it! Attiyat-Allah releases Aboukhlal through the centre, with two Portugal defenders left in his wake, but the latter only prods an attempted chip straight into the chest of the goalkeeper!
RED CARD	90+3'	Walid Cheddira	Morocco · Striker #21	OFF! A clumsy challenge on Joao Felix sees Cheddira receive his second yellow card, and the substitute striker is sent off! Morocco are down to 10 men, with five minutes of stoppage time to go!
COMMENTARY	90+1'	SAVE! Bounou denies Ronaldo with a save low down in the centre of his goal, after the striker wraps his foot around a throughball to the brink of the box! It was no more than a half-chance, but Portugal need something - anything - to go in now!
YELLOW CARD	90+1'	Walid Cheddira	Morocco · Striker #21	For a rugged aerial challenge on Pepe, substitute Cheddira is booked by the referee.
YELLOW CARD	87'	Vitinha	Portugal · Midfielder #16	Vitinha catches Ounahi as the Morocco midfielder attempts a volleyed clearance from the edge of the box. The referee sees fit to issue a booking.
COMMENTARY	83'	SUPER STOP! Bounou flings himself up to the top-right of his goal to palm away a thunderous strike from Joao Felix, who receives the ball from Ronaldo's layoff on the edge of the box! What a save! Could that make all the difference in a few minutes time?
SUBSTITUTION	82'	IN	Yahya Jabrane	Morocco · Midfielder #26	OUT	Sofiane Boufal	Morocco · Striker #17	A tired Boufal is also withdrawn by Regragui, as Jabrane is introduced for the closing stages.
SUBSTITUTION	82'	IN	Zakaria Aboukhlal	Morocco · Striker #14	OUT	Hakim Ziyech	Morocco · Striker #7	Soon after going down injured and then making a brief recovery, Ziyech is replaced; Aboukhlal comes on in his place.

YELLOW CARD	70'	Achraf Dari	Morocco · Defender #20	For lunging recklessly into a tackle on Leao on the right flank, substitute Dari is shown the game's first yellow card.

SUBSTITUTION	69'	IN	Rafael Leão	Portugal · Striker #15	OUT	Gonçalo Ramos	Portugal · Striker #26	By contrast with his incredible impact against Switzerland, Ramos has endured a frustrating shift today. He now makes way for powerful winger Leao up front.

COMMENTARY	58'	WIDE! Left in space near the penalty spot, Ramos heads Otavio's cross wide of the target! It was a presentable chance, of which he has been starved so far today.

COMMENTARY	56'	Morocco captain Saiss, who started the game heavily bandaged, lies on the turf and seems unable to continue. He's been struggling for much of the match, but appears the centre-back's race is now run.

COMMENTARY	49'	SAVE! Costa reacts to repel the ball at close quarters, after El Yamiq connects with a Ziyech free-kick from the right flank. The goalkeeper spreads his body and keeps the ball out, before the rebound strikes the defender again and goes behind!
INSIGHTS	Half-time	Youssef En-Nesyri has scored his three World Cup goals from just three shots on target in the competition.
INSIGHTS	Half-time	Portugal's five attempts are the fewest they've had in the first half of a World Cup match in 2022.
INSIGHTS	Half-time	Joao Felix had three of Portugal's five attempts on goal in the first half, he hasn't had more shots in any previous game at this World Cup.
INSIGHTS	Half-time	Portugal have made the most errors leading to goals at World Cup 2022, doing so on three occasions so far.
INSIGHTS	Half-time	Portugal have lost their last six World Cup matches when behind at half time, with their only such win coming in the quarter-final in 1966 (5-3 against DPR Korea).
COMMENTARY	Half-time	Contrary to most expectations, neither side has taken a backwards step today, as Morocco and Portugal went toe to toe in an entertaining quarter-final encounter. The early stages saw the Selecao dominate the ball without creating many openings, but their opponents cut through on the counter several times before taking the lead through En-Nesyri's majestic header. Blessed with some sublime attacking talent on the bench, Portugal can reasonably hope to turn things around after the interval, but the Moroccan defence is not easily beaten.
COMMENTARY	45'	OFF THE BAR! An incredible effort from a narrow angle on the right edge of the box sees Fernandes clip the face of the crossbar, following Dalot's flick-on from the flank! It was an instinctive strike, which left Bounou beaten, but ultimately bounces away to safety!
INSIGHTS	43'	Youssef En-Nesyri is Morocco’s leading scorer in World Cup history (3).
GOOOAAALLL!!!	42'	Morocco	1	-	0	Portugal	Youssef En-Nesyri	Morocco · Striker #19	Asst: Y. A. Allah	MOROCCO LEAD! At the third time of asking, En-Nesyri strikes! Having missed two earlier headed chances, the Sevilla striker leaps brilliantly to beat Costa to a cross from the left by Attiyat-Allah. He nods the ball into the back of the unguarded net; putting the Atlas Lions 1-0 ahead just before the break!
COMMENTARY	31'	CLOSE! Meeting a dropping ball with a driven half-volley from the edge of the box, Joao Felix sees his goalbound effort blocked at close range by El Yamiq, who had previously failed to clear his lines. That was a rare opening in this first half for the Selecao!
COMMENTARY	26'	MISS! Another fine chance to score goes astray for En-Nesyri, who again mistimes his header. This time, the striker turns Ziyech's inswinging free-kick over the crossbar when virtually unmarked in the area!
COMMENTARY	7'	MISS! From Ziyech's outswinging corner, En-Nesyri spurns a golden chance to open the scoring; mistiming a free header from only a few yards out and sending the ball over the crossbar!
COMMENTARY	5'	SAVE! Bounou reacts sharply to dive down to his left and turn behind Joao Felix's diving header, which is sent towards the centre of the goal! It was a superb cross from Fernandes' right-sided free-kick.
INSIGHTS	0'	At 26 years, 332 days old, Portugal are fielding their youngest ever start XI in a World Cup match.
INSIGHTS	0'	No goalkeeper has kept more clean sheets for Morocco at a single World Cup than Yassine Bounou at the 2022 edition (2) – level with Ezaki Zaki in 1986.
INSIGHTS	0'	Yassine Bounou is making his 50th appearance in all competitions for Morocco today.
INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	This will be the third ever meeting between Morocco and Portugal, with the previous two both coming at the World Cup. Morocco won the first in a group stage clash in 1986 (3-1), before Portugal won 1-0 in the 2018 tournament where they also shared a group.	2	There have been 11 previous games in the knockout stages of the World Cup between African and European teams, with nine of those being won by the European side. The two exceptions are Senegal’s 2-1 extra time victory over Sweden in 2002 (round of 16) and Morocco’s penalty shootout victory over Spain in the previous round this year.	3	Morocco are looking to become the first African team to qualify for the semi-final of a World Cup tournament. Indeed, each of the previous three African sides to reach a quarter-final were all eliminated at this stage: Cameroon in 1990, Senegal in 2002 and Ghana in 2010.	4	This will be Portugal’s third quarter-final at the World Cup, while they’ve progressed in each of the previous two – 5-3 v DPR Korea in 1966 and 3-1 in a penalty shootout v England in 2006. Portugal scored as many goals in their last game v Switzerland (6) as they had in their previous eight matches in the World Cup knockout stages combined.	5	Morocco come into this match on a five-game unbeaten run at the World Cup (W2 D3); their longest ever streak without defeat in the competition. Four of these games have come under Walid Regragui (W2 D2), who will become the first African manager to take charge of a World Cup quarter-final in this match.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Following their scintillating display against the Swiss, Portugal make just one change to their starting XI today. Neves comes in for Carvalho in central midfield, as Ronaldo remains benched and Benfica forward Ramos leads the line up front. Perhaps indicating a changing of the guard, at 26 years and 332 days old, the Selecao field their youngest ever team in a World Cup finals fixture.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Largely unchanged throughout the finals, Morocco have been forced into making two switches today. Centre-back Nayef Aguerd and full-back Noussair Mazraoui both miss out through injury, so El Yamiq and Attiyat-Allah come into the starting XI. Hakimi and Amrabat have overcome fitness fears to feature, while Saiss is also available to captain the Atlas Lions from the heart of defence.
