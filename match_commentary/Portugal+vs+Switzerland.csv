COMMENTARY	Post Match	Portugal have strolled into the World Cup quarter-finals with a memorable performance! They've utterly thrashed Switzerland in Lusail. The headlines will deservedly go to Ramos for his hat-trick, but this was a true team effort from the Portuguese. Fernando Santos got every decision he had to make right. The Swiss looked beaten by half-time and were.

INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	This will be the third meeting between Portugal and Switzerland in 2022, having faced each other twice in the UEFA Nations League in June. Portugal won 4-0 in a match played in Lisbon, before Switzerland won 1-0 in Geneva a week later.	2	Portugal and Switzerland have faced each other in competitive action on six occasions in the 21st Century, while both teams have won three games apiece. Their only previous clash at a major tournament (World Cups and Euros) came amongst these meetings, with Switzerland winning 2-0 at Euro 2008.	3	Portugal will be looking to reach the quarter-finals of the World Cup for just a third time, previously doing so in 1966 and in 2006. However, they’ve failed to win any of their last five knockout games at the tournament, losing each of their last four, including defeats at this stage in 2010 (0-1 vs Spain) and in 2018 (1-2 vs Uruguay).	4	Switzerland won two of their matches in the group stage at the 2022 World Cup (L1 v Brazil), and will be looking to win three games in a single World Cup tournament for the first time in their history.	5	Portugal have opened the scoring in eight of their last nine World Cup games. However last time out against Korea Republic, they lost having scored first for the very first time at the World Cup (P19 W15 D3 L1).
