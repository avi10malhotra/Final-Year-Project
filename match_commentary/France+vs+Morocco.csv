INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	France are the first nation to reach back-to-back World Cup finals since Brazil in 2002, and first European country to do so since Germany in 1990.	2	This defeat ended a six-game unbeaten run at the World Cup for Morocco (W3 D3), and was their first loss at the finals since a 1-0 defeat to Portugal in the group stage in 2018.	3	France have reached the World Cup final for a fourth time, all since 1998 (1998, 2006, 2018, 2022). This is twice as many as any other nation in this period.
COMMENTARY	Post Match	France advance to their second World Cup final in a row courtesy of a 2-0 win over Morocco in their semi-final clash. Theo Hernandez put Les Bleus in front in the fifth minute with a close-range finish after Kylian Mbappe's effort was blocked. France spurned opportunities to double their advantage, which gave Morocco hope as Jawad El Yamiq struck the post. However, Didier Deschamps' men remained strong at the back and duly notched their second to wrap up the contest through substitute Randal Kolo Muani, who scored his first international goal to send his team into the final.
INSIGHTS	90+6'	Randal Kolo Muani's goal was the second-quickest scored by a substitute in a World Cup knockout stage match (44 seconds), after Denmark's Ebbe Sande against Nigeria in 1998 (26 seconds).
COMMENTARY	90+4'	OFF THE LINE! Kounde prevents Hamdallah from scoring from close range with a great block on the line. Attiyat-Allah makes a great run down the left flank and sees his shot from the byline saved by Lloris. The loose ball travels out to Ounahi, who lashes a strike on the half-volley towards goal. Hernandez sticks out a boot to make a block, but Hamdallah latches onto it and steers a strike towards the net. Kounde is in the right place at the right time to deny the forward and Morocco.
COMMENTARY	90+4'	OVER! Ounahi takes possession on the edge of the France box and shoots with power, but his effort is deflected over the bar.
INSIGHTS	83'	Jawad El Yamiq has completed 77 passes in this match so far, the most ever by a Moroccan player in a World Cup match.
INSIGHTS	80'	Youssef En-Nesyri had three touches against France, the fewest on record (since 1966) by any player to play 60+ minutes in a World Cup match.
GOOOAAALLL!!!	79'	France	2	-	0	Morocco	Randal Kolo Muani	France · Striker #12	GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!! KOLO MUANI CONVERTS AT THE BACK POST!!!!! 2-0 FRANCE!!!!!! Kolo Muani scores his first international goal with his first touch in the game to surely send France back to the World Cup final. Mbappe causes havoc in the final third as he twists and turns to fire towards goal. His effort is charged down, but the rebound falls kindly for Kolo Muani to steer the ball past Bounou from six yards. What a time to get your first goal!
SUBSTITUTION	79'	IN	Randal Kolo Muani	France · Striker #12	OUT	Ousmane Dembélé	France · Midfielder #11	Kolo Muani replaces Dembele, who was off the pace in the contest today.

COMMENTARY	72'	WIDE! Thuram rises at the back post to attack Griezmann's free-kick from the left flank, but he can only glance his header wide of the right post.
COMMENTARY	69'	OFFSIDE! Mbappe is beyond the last man again after latching onto Griezmann's offload. His left-footed blast is charged down anyway.
SUBSTITUTION	67'	IN	Zakaria Aboukhlal	Morocco · Striker #14	OUT	Sofiane Boufal	Morocco · Midfielder #17	Aboukhlal comes on to replace Boufal, who had a fine game in the final third.
SUBSTITUTION	66'	IN	Abderrazak Hamdallah	Morocco · Striker #9	OUT	Youssef En-Nesyri	Morocco · Striker #19	En-Nesyri makes way from the final third and is replaced by Hamdallah.
SUBSTITUTION	65'	IN	Marcus Thuram	France · Striker #26	OUT	Olivier Giroud	France · Striker #9	Thuram enters the action to replace Giroud for Les Bleus, which sees Mbappe move into a central position.

SUBSTITUTION	46'	IN	Yahia Attiyat Allah	Morocco · Defender #25	OUT	Noussair Mazraoui	Morocco · Defender #3	Mazraoui is withdrawn at the break due to injury and is replaced by Attiat-Allah.
INSIGHTS	Half-time	Antoine Griezmann has created 20 chances for France at the 2022 World Cup; just the fourth time on record (since 1966) that a France player has created 20+ in a single World Cup tournament, after Youri Djorkaeff in 1998 (21) and Alain Giresse in 1982 and 1986 (24 in both).
INSIGHTS	Half-time	France have never lost a World Cup match when leading at half-time, winning 25 times and drawing once.
COMMENTARY	Half-time	France are 45 minutes away from reaching successive World Cup finals as Theo Hernandez's strike has handed them a 1-0 lead at the break against Morocco. Hernandez was on the spot at the back post to convert with a fine finish after Kylian Mbappe had two efforts blocked. Morocco did respond as Azz-Eddine Ounahi tested Hugo Lloris, who produced a solid save, while Jawad El Yamiq struck the post with an overhead kick. France, too, had chances to take command with Olivier Giroud missing two good opportunities. It has been a fascinating half and the second period should be a thriller.
INSIGHTS	45'	Three of the four previous sides to go 1-0 up within the opening 5 minutes of a World Cup semi-final went on to lose; the only exception was Brazil against France in 1958.
COMMENTARY	45'	OFF THE POST! El Yamiq almost equalises before the break with a stunner. The defender latches on to a loose ball following a Ziyech corner and connects with an overhead kick. His effort travels towards the bottom-left corner, but it strikes the post and Les Bleus scramble away the loose ball.
COMMENTARY	40'	WIDE! Varane makes a run to the near post to connect with Griezmann's low cross from the right flank, but he steers his effort harmlessly wide.
COMMENTARY	36'	CHANCES! Mbappe is played through on goal by Tchouameni, but his effort is cleared from the six-yard box by Hakimi. Hernandez gathers the loose ball and fires it straight to Giroud, who has space and time, only to place his effort wide of the left post.
YELLOW CARD	27'	Sofiane Boufal	Morocco · Midfielder #17	Hernandez has a worrying moment as Ziyech breaks in behind him. The full-back recovers, but takes a heavy touch back into his own box. It invites a challenge from Boufal, who catches Hernandez late and goes into the book.
SUBSTITUTION	21'	IN	Selim Amallah	Morocco · Midfielder #15	OUT	Romain Saïss	Morocco · Defender #6	Amallah comes onto the field to replace the injured Saiss. Morocco will likely change their shape to four at the back as Amallah slots into the midfield.
COMMENTARY	17'	OFF THE POST! France come inches away from a second goal as Giroud rattles the post. Saiss can barely move to clear a long ball, allowing it to bounce over his head. Giroud bursts away from him and lines up a blast on his left foot that crashes into the left post and goes behind.
COMMENTARY	17'	WIDE! Boufal charges at the France defence on the counter and offloads to Ziyech in space. He looks to shoot on his right foot, but he slips as he pulls the trigger and places his effort wide.
INSIGHTS	11'	Theo Hernández’s opener for France (4:39) is the earliest scored by any side in a World Cup semi-final since 1958, when Vavá scored within two minutes for Brazil against France.
COMMENTARY	10'	SAVE! Ounahi almost responds for Morocco, but Lloris makes a fine save. The midfielder is played into space in the France half and he drives to the edge of the box. He curls a strike towards the bottom-right corner, but Lloris stretches to push the ball away from goal.
INSIGHTS	5'	France haven't lost any of their last 25 World Cup games when opening the scoring (W23 D2) since a 3-2 defeat to Poland in 1982.
GOOOAAALLL!!!	5'	France	1	-	0	Morocco	Theo Hernández	France · Defender #22	GOALLLLLLL!!!!!!!! HERNANDEZ FIRES FRANCE AHEAD!!!! 1-0!!! Les Bleus take the lead as Hernandez holds his composure from close range to beat Bounou. France cut Morocco open down the inside-right channel as Varane releases Griezmann. He offloads back to Mbappe, who sees two strikes blocked. However, the rebound from his second effort falls kindly for Hernandez to score with a fine finish.
INSIGHTS	0'	Hugo Lloris will make his 19th appearance at the World Cup, equalling Manuel Neuer as the goalkeeper with the most games in the history of the competition.
INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	France have never lost against Morocco, with all five of their previous meetings coming in friendlies (W3 D2). The most recent encounter was a 2-2 draw in Saint-Denis in November 2007.	2	France have alternated between victory and defeat in their six World Cup meetings with African nations, losing 1-0 against Tunisia last time out in this year's group stage. No team has ever lost against two different African sides in the same World Cup before.	3	Morocco are looking to become the first African nation to reach the World Cup final – indeed, this game will be the first ever World Cup semi-final contested by an African side.	4	France are playing in their seventh World Cup semi-final – having been eliminated from each of their first three (1958, 1982, 1986), they've won each of their last three matches at this stage (1998, 2006, 2018).	5	No opposition player has scored against Morocco so far at the 2022 World Cup, with their only goal conceded coming via an own goal against Canada. They've kept four clean sheets so far at this tournament, with the last two sides to record five in a single edition going on to lift the trophy (Spain 2010, Italy 2006).
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	A late change for Morocco before kick-off as Aguerd has been ruled out and is replaced by Dari.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Morocco have made two changes to their side from the win over Portugal last time out. Aguerd and Mazraoui both come into the side to replace Attiat-Allah and Amallah after missing the last game due to injury. Amallah drops to the bench for the first time in the knockout stage. Walid Cheddira misses out after being sent off late in the quarter-final victory.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	France have been forced into two changes from their win over England. Upamecano and Adrien Rabiot have both been struggling with illness. Rabiot misses out completely and is replaced by Fofana in the middle of the park. Konate gets the call to replace Upamecano in the backline, but the latter does have a place on the bench.
