COMMENTARY	Post Match	Portugal are through to the knockout stages after a 2-0 win over Uruguay. Portugal took the lead with their first shot on target. Fernandes curled what was supposed to be a cross straight into the net, and though Ronaldo tried to claim a deft header, he didn't get a touch. Gomez hit the post for Uruguay before Suarez and De Arrascaete also came close. A dubious handball decision went against Gimenez and Fernandes coolly slotted the penalty home, before being denied a hat-trick by the post deep in stoppage time.
INSIGHTS	90+10'	Bruno Fernandes is the first Portugal player with two goals and two assists in a World Cup tournament since 1966 (José Augusto and José Torres both did so).
COMMENTARY	90+9'	OFF THE POST! Fernandes comes so close to a hat-trick! It's good work from Leao at the byline as he pulls it back to Fernandes on the edge of the box. He sets himself before drilling a low shot back towards the near post, but it smacks off the woodwork.
COMMENTARY	90+8'	GOOD SAVE! It's well worked by Portugal down their left this time and Guerreiro lifts a deep cross into the far post. Fernandes is unmarked as he runs onto it and he fires it towards goal first time, but Rochet saves it with his legs.
GOOOAAALLL!!!	90+3'	Portugal	2	-	0	Uruguay	Bruno Fernandes	Portugal · Midfielder #8	Penalty Goal	FERNANDES SCORES! He wasn't originally stood over the spot-kick, but he coolly steps up to take it. It's a slow run-up and he stutters it just in front of the ball before doing his trademark hop and calmly slotting the ball down the left of the goal, sending the keeper the wrong way. 2-0 Portugal!
COMMENTARY	90'	PENALTY TO PORTUGAL! The referee is called over to the monitor to have a look at the handball incident. Fernandes slid the ball through Gimenez's legs and as he dropped down, the defender's hand lands on it behind his back. It was completely accidental, but the referee points to the spot!
PENALTY	90'	Penalty to Portugal! After a VAR review, a penalty is awarded.
YELLOW CARD	89'	Rúben Dias	Portugal · Defender #4	Dias is continuing the protests over the handball by Gimenez and he goes into the book for dissent.

COMMENTARY	79'	SAVE! Uruguay have come to life here and Valverde slides a lovely throughball into De Arrascaeta. Costa rushes off his line, forcing the substitute to rush his shot, and he fires it straight at the keeper.
COMMENTARY	78'	CLOSE! De Arrascaeta swings the free-kick from the left to the near post and Gomez throws himself forward but can't make contact. It bounces through to Suarez in the six-yard box and he spins before firing just wide.
YELLOW CARD	77'	João Félix	Portugal · Striker #11	It's a clumsy one from Joao Felix as he catches Suarez with the follow-through and he's shown a yellow card.
COMMENTARY	75'	OFF THE POST! Pellistri is causing all sorts of problems down the right, and he squares it to Gomez inside the D. He takes the shot first time, and it curls past Costa but smacks off the near post.

INSIGHTS	60'	Portugal have never lost when they've scored first in a World Cup match (W14 D3).
COMMENTARY	58'	CHANCE! It's better from Uruguay here and Varela makes a good run down the right before curling it into the box. Cavani drops back to lose Pepe but then scuffs at the volley and it bounces harmlessly wide of the far post.
INSIGHTS	54'	Aged 37 years and 296 days, Cristiano Ronaldo is the oldest player to score in consecutive World Cup appearances.
GOOOAAALLL!!!	54'	Portugal	1	-	0	Uruguay	Bruno Fernandes	Portugal · Midfielder #8	Asst: R. Guerreiro	FERNANDES SCORES! Portugal open the scoring with their first shot on target in the game! Guerreiro touches it into Fernandes, who looks to run down the left before changing his mind and cutting back inside. He curls what looks like a great cross to Ronaldo in the middle, but it's just too high for him and it beats Rochet. 1-0 Portugal!
COMMENTARY	52'	WIDE! There was a short break in play for a pitch invader, but Portugal move it quickly upfield when the game restarts. Fernandes switches it out to Joao Felix in space on the left of the box, and he drills his low shot into the side netting.
COMMENTARY	50'	Neves was caught by a late challenge from Vecino and he's been down for a long time. He's receiving treatment on his knee, and he's moving gingerly when he gets back up, but he'll be carrying on.
INSIGHTS	49'	Cristiano Ronaldo has levelled with Eusébio for the most World Cup goals for Portugal (9).
INSIGHTS	Half-time	Portugal have failed to have a shot on target in the first half of a World Cup game for just the third time (also 0 vs South Korea in 2002 and Côte d'Ivoire in 2010).
COMMENTARY	Half-time	It's goalless at the break between Portugal and Uruguay. Portugal dominated possession for the majority of the first half but didn't manage to test Rochet in Uruguay's goal despite getting into some good positions. Uruguay had the golden chance to take the lead in the game though with Bentancur making a brilliant run through Portugal's half before hitting his shot straight at Costa.
YELLOW CARD	44'	Mathías Olivera	Uruguay · Midfielder #16	Fernandes tried to take a quick free-kick and Olivera ran across to block it. It's a needless yellow card to pick up for the wing-back.
SUBSTITUTION	42'	IN	Raphaël Guerreiro	Portugal · Defender #5	OUT	Nuno Mendes	Portugal · Defender #19	Mendes stayed down after an awkward landing and it looks like he hurt his neck. He goes straight down the tunnel after treatment, with Guerreiro coming on to replace him.
YELLOW CARD	38'	Rúben Neves	Portugal · Midfielder #18	Varela has a lot of space down the right and Neves takes one for the team by dragging him back. It earns him a yellow card.
COMMENTARY	32'	GREAT CHANCE! Vecino just nudges it into Bentancur's path in the centre circle, and he makes a brilliant run right through the middle. He dribbles past two on the edge of the box before firing his shot straight at Costa, who spreads himself to make the save.
INSIGHTS	6'	Cristiano Ronaldo has created three chances in this game, his most in a World Cup match since 2010 (five vs North Korea). He's the oldest player (37 years, 296 days) to create three chances in a game since Roger Milla in 1990 for Cameroon vs England (38 years, 42 days).
INSIGHTS	6'	Rodrigo Bentancur has received the earliest booking in a World Cup match at this year's tournament (5 mins, 43 seconds). It's the earliest a Uruguay player has been booked in a World Cup game since 1986, José Alberto Batista vs Scotland (54 seconds).
YELLOW CARD	6'	Rodrigo Bentancur	Uruguay · Midfielder #6	Bentancur is slow to get across to Dias and just steps on the defender's heel with his studs when he reaches him. He's shown an early yellow card.
INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	This is the second FIFA World Cup meeting between Portugal and Uruguay, with the South Americans eliminating Portugal in the second round of the 2018 edition in Russia.	2	Uruguay have won four of their last five FIFA World Cup matches against European nations (including a 2-1 victory over Portugal), though did lose to France in their last such match. The Sky Blue had won just two of their previous 25 such matches before this run (D8 L15).	3	Portugal have won just one of their last nine meetings with South American nations in all competitions (D3 L5), beating Argentina 1-0 in a friendly in November 2014.	4	Following their 3-2 win against Ghana, Portugal are looking to win their opening two group games for the third time at the World Cup. They previously did so in 1966 and 2006, eventually reaching the semi-finals in both of those editions.	5	Uruguay have failed to score in their last two World Cup games – only once have they done so in three consecutive games at the tournament (between 1986 and 1990). However, the South American nation have won their second group game in each of the last three editions of the World Cup.
