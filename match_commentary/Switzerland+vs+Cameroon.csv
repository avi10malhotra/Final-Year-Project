COMMENTARY	Post Match	Embolo scored the only goal of the game to get Switzerland off to a winning start in Group G. Second-best in the first half, the Swiss scored three minutes after the break. Xhaka started the move, sliding the ball down the right to Shaqiri who picked out Embolo in the middle of the box. Unmarked, the striker lashed the ball past Onana who had no chance. Switzerland could have scored a second through a similar move. This time it was Vargas who had the scoring opportunity, but the Inter goalkeeper pushed his attempt wide.

Yet to have a shot on target, Switzerland's best chance of the half came through Akanji. He leapt the highest to meet a corner from Vargas but missed the goal.
COMMENTARY	45+1'	WIDE! Akanji has Switzerland's best opportunity of the half. He jumps the highest to meet a corner from Vargas, but he heads the ball wide. He only gets a small amount of contact on the cross and may have scored with a better connection.
