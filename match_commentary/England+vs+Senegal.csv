INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	England have reached the quarter-final of the World Cup for a 10th time, reaching this stage twice each under Walter Winterbottom (1954 and 1962), Alf Ramsey (1966 and 1970), Bobby Robson (1986 and 1990), Sven-Göran Eriksson (2002 and 2006) and Gareth Southgate (2018 and 2022).	2	Senegal conceded three goals in a single World Cup match for only a second time, after their 3-3 draw with Uruguay in the 2002 group stage. This was the nation’s heaviest ever major tournament defeat (World Cup and Africa Cup of Nations).	3	England have scored 12 goals in four matches at this year’s World Cup, the Three Lions’ joint-most at a single major tournament (World Cup and Euros), level with their 12 goals at the 2018 World Cup.
COMMENTARY	Post Match	The full-time whistle goes, sealing England's passage to the quarter-finals of the World Cup! The Three Lions began the second half as they finished the first, scoring their third goal through Saka within 12 minutes of the restart. From then on, it was a case of keeping Senegal at arm's length, and England certainly did that, nearly adding to their lead on several occasions and restricting their opponents to the occasional pop-shot as they closed out a 3-0 victory, to set up a mouth-watering clash with France in the last eight.
COMMENTARY	90+1'	WIDE!!! Grealish cuts inside before feeding Shaw to his left. He dinks the ball over the top, and Rashford slides in to hit the ball, but can only find the side netting!

SUBSTITUTION	82'	IN	Kalvin Phillips	England · Midfielder #14	OUT	Jordan Henderson	England · Midfielder #8	Henderson comes off next for England, having sent them on their way with that first-half goal. Kalvin Phillips comes on, as England look to consolidate their healthy lead.
COMMENTARY	80'	CHANCE!!!! A cross-field pass is thundered onto by Rashford, who bursts down the right before crossing early for Kane. The captain races into the middle and stretches to connect with the ball, but isn't able to get there and the ball rolls away!

SUBSTITUTION	77'	IN	Eric Dier	England · Defender #15	OUT	John Stones	England · Defender #5	Stones also comes off for England, and Eric Dier replaces him at the heart of the defence.

YELLOW CARD	76'	Kalidou Koulibaly	Senegal · Defender #3	Kane drops deep to aid his midfield, but is needlessly shoved to the ground by Koulibaly. The clash of the respective captains results in an England free-kick and a yellow card for Koulibaly.
COMMENTARY	74'	WIDE!!!! Senegal win a free-kick 30 yards from Pickford's goal, and Pape Sarr steps up to drill a low shot past the wall and into the side netting!

INSIGHTS	57'	Phil Foden is the first England player to assist two goals in a single World Cup knockout stage game since David Beckham against Denmark in the 2002 round of 16.
GOOOAAALLL!!!	57'	England	3	-	0	Senegal	Bukayo Saka	England · Striker #17	Asst: P. Foden	GOOOOOAAAALLL!!! England make it three!!! Kane looks to have lost the ball but Foden charges onto it, searing down the left wing. He dribbles to the byline and fires the ball across the face of goal, where Saka arrives at the front post to lift it over Mendy and into the back of the net!! That's three in the tournament for Saka, and just as many for England in this game as they make it 3-0!
COMMENTARY	56'	SAVED!!! Kane tries his luck from a good 30 yards out, and although Edouard Mendy gets down to the ball, he very nearly spills it through his legs before regathering!
INSIGHTS	47'	Phil Phoden (22 years and 190 days) is the second youngest player to provide two assists in a World Cup Knockout game (since 1966) after Ronaldo against Denmark in 1998 (21 and 284).

INSIGHTS	Half-time	England have taken a 2-0 lead in the first half of a World Cup knockout match for the first time since the 2002 round of 16 v Denmark.
COMMENTARY	Half-time	That's the first half done and dusted, and what a way for England to enter the break! The Three Lions had looked lackadaisical for much of the half, almost gifting Senegal the lead with two mistakes which lead to chances, but came to life inside the final 10 minutes. Bellingham was instrumental in both goals, making the darting run down the left to set up Henderson's opener, before slaloming through midfield on the break to start the move which Kane finished off. Those two pieces of brilliance see England lead 2-0, and have them in total control here.
GOOOAAALLL!!!	45+3'	England	2	-	0	Senegal	Harry Kane	England · Striker #9	Asst: P. Foden	GOOOOOOAAAAALLLL!!!! What a move to double the lead!!! Bellingham latches onto a loose ball and sparks an England counter-attack. He strides through the middle before feeding Foden, who immediately passes to the unmarked Kane. The England captain was yet to score at this tournament, but he lashes the ball beyond a helpless Mendy to rattle the back of the net and put England 2-0 up right on half-time!
COMMENTARY	43'	SAVED!!! Shaw drives forward to intercept a pass and race into the box. He's forced wide upon receiving Bellingham's pass, but his cross back to the middle is parried behind by Edouard Mendy!
COMMENTARY	41'	OVER!!! Saka stands up his marker down the right before squaring the ball inside. Kane arrives on the edge of the box to hit it, but drags his effort high and wide of the target!
GOOOAAALLL!!!	39'	England	1	-	0	Senegal	Jordan Henderson	England · Midfielder #8	Asst: J. Bellingham	GOOOOOOAAAAALLLL!!!! England strike first!!! Kane drops deep and releases Bellingham sprinting away in front. He draws several defenders before he cuts the ball back, and Henderson is on hand to slot it below Edouard Mendy and into the back of the net!!! They've hardly threatened so far, but just like that, England lead this knockout tie by a score of 1-0!
INSIGHTS	38'	Con 19 años y 158 dias, Jude Bellingham es el jugador más joven en asistir en un partido de Inglaterra en Mundiales, desde al menos 1966.
COMMENTARY	31'	SAVED!!! A poor pass back from Saka is latched onto by Sarr. He cuts inside across the edge of the box before finding Dia, whose shot from the left is parried by the outstretched glove of Pickford! Another scare for England, and they've been their own worst enemies at times so far!
COMMENTARY	23'	OVER!!!! A huge let off for England!!! Maguire's pass out the back is intercepted and Senegal flood forward. Diatta's cross is mis-hit by Dia, and the ball bounces in front of the England goal, but Sarr arrives and blasts it over the top! It looked easier to score that one!
INSIGHTS	16+3'	Harry Kane is the eighth different player to score for England at the 2022 World Cup - it's the most different scorers (excl. own goals) that the Three Lions have ever had at a single edition of any major tournament (World Cup or Euros).
COMMENTARY	4'	CHANCE!!! A gap opens up in England's midfield and a throughball through it finds Dia. He bursts between Stones and Maguire as he looks to create shooting space, but a crucial touch from Maguire sends the ball back to Pickford!
INSIGHTS	1'	Aged 32 years and 170 days, Jordan Henderson is England's second-oldest ever World Cup scorer, after Tom Finney against USSR in 1958 (36y 64d).
INSIGHTS	1'	Jude Bellingham (19y 158d) is the second teenager to start in a FIFA World Cup knockout stage game for England, after Michael Owen (18y 198d) against Argentina in 1998.
INSIGHTS	0'	Jude Bellingham is the first teenager to assist in a World Cup knockout stage game since 1966
INSIGHTS	0'	Jon Stones' attempt in the 21st minute was the second longest wait for the first shot in a World Cup 2022 match, (France v Tunisia - 25th minute).
INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	This will be the first ever senior international between England and Senegal. It will be the 13th time that England’s first ever match against a nation has come in the World Cup; the Three Lions lost just one of the previous 12 such instances (W7 D4), a 0-1 defeat to USA in 1950.	2	Senegal have alternated between winning (3) and not winning (D1 L2) in their six World Cup meetings with European opponents, losing 2-0 against Netherlands in their most recent game (MD1 of this tournament).	3	England have never lost in seven previous World Cup matches against African opposition (W4 D3); their only previous such game in the knockout stages came against Cameroon in the 1990 quarter-final, winning 3-2 after extra-time, with their goals coming from David Platt and two Gary Lineker penalties.	4	African nations have lost eight of their nine World Cup knockout round games against European sides, with the exception being Senegal's 2-1 win over Sweden in the round of 16 in 2002. However, in all competitions, England have never lost against an African side in their history (W14 D6).	5	England are looking to reach the quarter-final in consecutive editions of the World Cup for the first time since 2002/2006 – the Three Lions have been eliminated from just two of their seven round of 16 ties at the tournament, doing so against Germany in 2010 (1-4) and via penalty shootout against Argentina in 1998.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Despite missing injured talisman Sadio Mane, Senegal still scored five goals in their three group games, with several of their forward line stepping up in the process. Boulaye Dia starts up front having scored their first of the tournament against Qatar, while to his left, Ismaila Sarr will be looking to add to the penalty he scored in Senegal’s 2-1 win over Ecuador.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	England make a single change, which sees Bukayo Saka come in for Marcus Rashford. Saka scored twice in England’s opening 6-2 win over Iran, while Rashford netted twice to seal a 3-0 win over Wales in their final group game. Rashford also came off the bench to score against Iran, and Southgate will be hoping for a similar impact in this game. Raheem Sterling is absent from the matchday squad due to a family issue, but is expected to be back should England progress to the next round.
