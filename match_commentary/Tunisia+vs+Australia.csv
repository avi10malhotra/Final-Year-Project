INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	All three of Australia's wins at the FIFA World Cup have been against teams from different continents (Asia, Europe, Africa), the joint-highest such record in the competition, along with Algeria and Iran.	2	Tunisia have failed to score in 53% of their matches at the World Cup (9/17), though this is just the second time they've failed to score in their opening two games at a single edition of the tournament, after 1998.	3	Australia have scored the opening goal in both of their games at the 2022 World Cup – they had only gone 1-0 up in two of their 16 games in the competition before this.
COMMENTARY	Post Match	Australia secure their first victory at a World Cup since 2010 by beating Tunisia 1-0 to give their hopes of reaching the last 16 a huge boost.

Tunisia pressed and threatened briefly through efforts from Youssef Msakni, but the Socceroos were resolute at the back, led by Harry Souttar, to hold out for the three points.

INSIGHTS	Half-time	Tunisia have attempted 17 shots at the 2022 World Cup so far, but have only hit the target with one of those. Indeed, they're still looking for their first goal in the current tournament.
COMMENTARY	Half-time	Mitchell Duke's header has handed Australia a 1-0 lead at the break in their World Cup clash against Tunisia. Duke glanced Craig Goodwin's deflected cross into the net to get the breakthrough for the Socceroos. It did take time for Tunisia to respond, but they did come close as Harry Souttar produced a good block to deny Mohamed Drager and Youssef Msakni fired wide of the post from close range. Australia have the lead, but it is a close game.
COMMENTARY	45+3'	MSAKNI HAS TO SCORE! The forward latches on to a cutback from Jebali from the right flank, but steers his right-footed strike wide of the right post. Msakni at least had to hit the target there.

COMMENTARY	41'	WHAT A BLOCK! Souttar saves a goal for Australia with a vital block to deny Drager. Tunisia catch Australia out at the back with a quick throw-in down the left flank that plays Jebali into space. He turns before offloading to Drager, who fires at goal first-time. However, Souttar slides across and diverts his effort wide of the target.
COMMENTARY	38'	BLOCK! Msakni twists and turns in the final third and opens up room for a strike just inside the Australia box. Rowles does well to charge down his right-footed blast before the Socceroos clear.
COMMENTARY	34'	WIDE! Australia press and win a corner down the right flank. Goodwin fires a dangerous low ball towards the near post that Irvine flicks towards the target, only to send his effort narrowly wide of the right post.

The Socceroos take the lead as Duke glances a header beyond the reach of Dahmen. Goodwin raids down the left flank and drills a cross into the middle. It takes a deflection and falls perfectly for Duke to flick his header into the right corner away from the despairing dive of the Tunisia keeper. A huge goal for Australia.
COMMENTARY	21'	OVER! Drager has space in the final third and he opens up his body to strike at goal from 25 yards, only to send his effort over the top.
INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	This is just the third meeting between Tunisia and Australia in all competitions – Australia won 3-0 in a friendly in October 1997, before Tunisia won 2-0 at the 2005 Confederations Cup.	2	Australia are facing African opposition at the FIFA World Cup for just the second time (18th match overall) – they drew 1-1 with Ghana in 2010 in the other.	3	Against Denmark last time out, Tunisia kept just their second clean sheet in their 16 World Cup games -both of their shutouts have been in goalless draws (also against Germany in 1978).	4	Australia have lost six of their last seven World Cup matches (D1), conceding 18 goals in this spell. They could lose both of their first two games of a World Cup campaign for a third time, having also done so in 1974 and 2014.	5	Tunisia have avoided defeat in consecutive World Cup matches for the first time (W1 D1). However, they've lost four of their five group stage games played on MD2, with the exception being a 1-1 draw with Belgium in 2002.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Australia have also made one change to their side that lost to France last time out. Nathaniel Atkinson sustained an ankle injury in the contest and misses out as Karacic comes into the fold at right-back to replace him. Hrustic makes a return to the bench after overcoming his own fitness problems.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Tunisia have made one change to their side that drew with Denmark in their opener. Sliti comes into the side in the final third in place of Ben Slimane, who drops to the bench. Hannibal remains on the sideline from the start for Jalel Kadri's men.
