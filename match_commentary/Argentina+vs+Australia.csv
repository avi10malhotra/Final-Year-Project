INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	Argentina have progressed from five of their last six round of 16 matches at the World Cup, the only exception during this run coming in 2018 against eventual champions France.	2	The round of 16 remains the furthest stage that Australia have ever reached at the World Cup, also eliminated at this point of the competition in 2006 against Italy, who went on to lift the trophy.	3	Australia have lost each of their last four World Cup matches against South American sides, each time against a different team – Brazil (2006), Chile (2014), Peru (2018) and Argentina (2022).
COMMENTARY	Post Match	A goal in each half for Argentina prevented a late Australia surge from coming to fruition, sealing a 2-1 nervy but deserved victory. Despite few chances for either side in the first half, Messi capped his 1,000th game for club and country with his first World Cup knockout goal, finishing in clinical fashion following a free-kick that wasn’t adequately cleared. Alvarez’s strike three minutes before the hour looked to wrap up the result, but a late Goodwin strike - deemed an own goal thanks to Fernandez’s deflection - made it anything but easy in the end. Scaloni’s side would ultimately see out the remainder of the game without adding to their lead despite promising opportunities in injury time, but hung on to book their fourth quarter-final trip in the last five World Cups.
COMMENTARY	90+7'	AUSTRALIA ALMOST EQUALISE! A cross to the far post is controlled inside the penalty area with a lovely touch by Kuol, who immediately finds himself in enough space to turn. The substitute fires a low shot that Emiliano Martinez saves superbly, to the relief of all Argentina!
COMMENTARY	82'	WHAT A CHANCE! A simple one-two in midfield gets Behich in a bit of space, which he uses to gather pace on a charge towards goal. The full-back gets all the way into the penalty area and takes a touch before seeing his sliding shot blocked behind by a sliding Lisandro Martinez.

OWN GOAL!	77'	Argentina	2	-	1	Australia	Enzo Fernández	Argentina · Midfielder #24	Own Goal	AUSTRALIA GET ONE BACK! 2-1! GAME ON! It’s a goal out of absolutely nowhere, with Goodwin’s effort from 25 yards out following a repelled cross taking a touch off Fernandez’s face and wrong-footing the goalkeeper! It goes down as an own goal for the Benfica midfielder, giving the Socceroos a chance with 13 minutes left!

GOOOAAALLL!!!	57'	Argentina	2	-	0	Australia	Julián Álvarez	Argentina · Striker #9	ALVAREZ DOUBLES ARGENTINA’S LEAD! 2-0! Argentina’s pressing pays dividends, with the midfield stepping up immediately to try and win the ball back following Ryan’s throw. A poor pass back from Rowles puts the goalkeeper under pressure inside his area and allows Alvarez to steal it back and slot into an empty net!
SUBSTITUTION	50'	IN	Lisandro Martínez	Argentina · Defender #25	OUT	Papu Gómez	Argentina · Striker #17	The first substitution of the match is made by Argentina, who send Manchester United’s Lisandro Martinez on for Gomez.
COMMENTARY	Half-time	Argentina take a 1-0 lead into the interval at the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium, despite little separating them from Australia. Arnold’s side were organised and structured off the ball but were able to offer precious little going forward to trouble Emiliano Martinez. Scaloni’s team were not much better for their part, labouring to create chances despite an overwhelming share of the possession. Messi’s strike 10 minutes from time gave the Albiceleste the advantage following a cleared free-kick, which Mac Allister pounced on before sparking the critical passing move that ended with the captain’s low finish past a flailing Ryan; his first goal in the knockout stages of a World Cup for Argentina.
YELLOW CARD	38'	Miloš Degenek	Australia · Defender #2	Degenek’s swipe to Acuna’s face during an aerial duel is deemed worthy of a yellow card by the referee, who books the Australia full-back.

GOOOAAALLL!!!	35'	Argentina	1	-	0	Australia	Lionel Messi	Argentina · Striker #10	Asst: N. Otamendi	A GOAL FOR MESSI IN GAME NUMBER 1,000! 1-0 ARGENTINA! Messi’s initial free-kick into the six-yard box is repelled by Souttar, but the Albiceleste regain possession and look to hit from a central position in the second phase. Mac Allister plays a pass into Otamendi, whose first touch tees Messi up for a shot expertly and the captain meets it with a sweet hit into the bottom-left corner to beat Ryan!
INSIGHTS	25'	Mat Ryan and Mathew Leckie are both making their 10th appearance at the World Cup, the first Australian players to do so

YELLOW CARD	15'	Jackson Irvine	Australia · Striker #22	Irvine steps across Acuna cynically, sending the full-back up into the air and down with a thud. It’s a yellow card for the midfielder - the first booking of the match.
INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	This is the first meeting between Argentina and Australia since a September 2007 friendly, won 1-0 by Argentina thanks to a goal from Martin Demichelis. It’s their first ever meeting at the World Cup.	2	Australia’s only win over Argentina in seven meetings (D1 L5) was back in July 1988 in the Australia Bicentenary Gold Cup, winning 4-1 with goals from Paul Wade, Charlie Yankos (x2) and Vlado Bozinoski. Current manager Graham Arnold also played in the match for the Socceroos.	3	This will be Australia’s fifth World Cup match against a South American opponent, with the Socceroos winless in the previous four (D1 L3). Argentina’s only previous meetings with a team from Oceania are their seven games against Australia, none of which have come in the World Cup.	4	Argentina were eliminated at the round of 16 stage in the 2018 World Cup, losing to eventual winners France. They’ve never gone out before the quarter-final stage in consecutive World Cups since the round of 16 was introduced in 1986, last going out before the last-eight in consecutive years in 1958 and 1962 (eliminated in first group round both times).	5	Australia have reached the knockout stages of the World Cup for only the second time, also doing so back in 2006 under Guus Hiddink. They lost 1-0 to Italy in the round of 16 that year, with Francesco Totti scoring a last minute penalty to eliminate them.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Australia make a single alteration from the side that beat Denmark 1-0 last time out, with Baccus replacing Goodwin on the left wing.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Argentina make just one change from the XI that beat Poland 2-0 on Wednesday, with Gomez getting the start ahead of Di Maria.
