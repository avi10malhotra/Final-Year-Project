COMMENTARY	Post Match	Portugal get off the mark at the World Cup with a dramatic 3-2 victory over Ghana at the 974 Stadium. After a goalless first half, Cristiano Ronaldo opened the scoring with a controversial penalty to become the first man to score at five World Cups. Andre Ayew equalised for the Black Stars, but Joao Felix and Rafael Leao scored their first World Cup goals to put the Selecao in command.

Fernando Santos' men held on to secure the three points to get up and running in Group H.
