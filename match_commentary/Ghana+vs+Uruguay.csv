INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	Uruguay failed to advance to the knockout stages of the World Cup for the first time in four editions, while it was also the first tournament in this run that the South Americans failed to win at least two games in the group stage.	2	Ghana have failed to qualify past the group stage in their last two appearances at the World Cup (2014 and 2022), after the Black Stars advanced to the knockouts in their first two appearances at the finals (2006 and 2010).	3	Uruguay are unbeaten in all five of their World Cup meetings with African sides (W3 D2), while they have avoided defeat in both of their matches against Ghana in the competition (W1 D1). Uruguay’s previous meeting with the Black Stars at the finals was a penalty shootout victory in the quarter-finals of the 2010 edition.
COMMENTARY	Post Match	Uruguay and Ghana are both knocked out of the World Cup, despite a 2-0 win for Uruguay. Andre Ayew had the chance to give Ghana the lead from the spot after VAR awarded a penalty for a late challenge by Rochet, but his tame effort was saved. Two goals in six minutes from De Arrascaeta then put Uruguay in the driving seat and they were heading into the last 16 until a late goal for South Korea in the other game gave them a win. Uruguay were denied a penalty by VAR, and no matter how hard both sides pushed, they couldn't find the back of the net in stoppage time.
