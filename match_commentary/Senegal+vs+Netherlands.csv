Depay is one-on-one with Koulibaly and steps beyond him before shooting early. Mendy gets down to the effort, but can only parry it straight into the path of Klaassen, who arrives late to slot the ball into the empty net!

COMMENTARY	86'	Pape Gueye fires a good left-footed effort from 20 yards, and after seeing it late through the crowd, Noppert gets down low to his left to prevent the ball creeping in at his near post!
GOOOAAALLL!!!	84'	Senegal	0	-	1	Netherlands	Cody Gakpo	Netherlands · Midfielder #8	Asst: F. de Jong	GOOOOAAAALLL!!!! Deadlock, broken!!! De Jong whips a peach of a ball into the box, and Gakpo darts in behind the defence, beats Mendy to the ball, and heads it straight into the top corner!! What anticipation, and what a finish from the highly sought-after forward, and with just minutes left to play, the Dutch have a 1-0 lead!

SUBSTITUTION	73'	IN	Pape Gueye	Senegal · Midfielder #26	OUT	Cheikhou Kouyaté	Senegal · Midfielder #8	Kouyate's replacement in midfield comes on, returning Senegal to their full complement of players, and that replacement is Marseille's Pape Gueye.

COMMENTARY	65'	SAVED!!! We have our first real save of the match! Mendy strides forward and plays in Dia on the right side of the box. He shoots first-time, and it's a decent effort which is beaten wide by Noppert at his front post!
SUBSTITUTION	62'	IN	Ismail Jakobs	Senegal · Defender #14	OUT	Abdou Diallo	Senegal · Defender #22	Diallo has picked up a knock for Senegal and needs to come off, with Ismail Jakobs replacing the RB Leipzig defender.
SUBSTITUTION	62'	IN	Memphis Depay	Netherlands · Striker #10	OUT	Vincent Janssen	Netherlands · Striker #18	Stunted up front so far, Louis Van Gaal reacts by brining Janssen off for the Netherlands, and in his place comes Memphis Depay.
COMMENTARY	60'	BLOCKED! A ball into the Senegal box is headed clear, and De Jong tees up Berghuis. He steps beyond his man and shoots from the edge of the area, with his left-footed effort being blocked behind by Sabaly!
COMMENTARY	58'	CHANCE!! Diallo's ball from the left evades Gueye, but Diatta attempts a flying volley at the back post which he skews well wide of goal!
YELLOW CARD	56'	Matthijs de Ligt	Netherlands · Defender #3	De Ligt clatters into the back of Sarr as he collects the ball, touching none of the ball in the process, and the Holland centre-back picks up the first booking of the game.
COMMENTARY	55'	BLOCKED!!! A deflected loose ball drops to Sabaly in space, and the Senegal right-back bursts forward before smashing a shot from 25 yards, that the knee of Ake sends behind for a corner!
COMMENTARY	53'	OVER!!! Gakpo's corner is met by Van Dijk at the front post, who rises for a free header and sends the ball flying just over the top of Mendy's crossbar!
COMMENTARY	Half-time	That's 45 minutes done and dusted, and we have our first goalless first half of the 2022 World Cup! The game has certainly been an open one, but aside from a few half-chances, we've seen very little in the way of goalmouth action. Both sides are finding plenty of freedom out wide, and it's likely this will be the avenue one of them exploits best if and when we see the opening goal.
COMMENTARY	39'	SAVED!!! Dumfries' pass into the box is met by Janssen, who lays off Berghuis. He smashes the ball from the edge of the box, sending it beyond Mendy and flying just over the bar!
COMMENTARY	29'	CHANCE!!! De Jong looks to have recovered possession well inside his own box, but his wayward pass forward is latched onto by Gueye, who has two attempts blocked from the edge before De Jong clears!
COMMENTARY	25'	BLOCKED!!! Sarr takes in a cross-field pass and superbly beats Dumfries. He steps inside and whips a curling shot towards the far post, which is headed behind by Van Dijk for a Senegal corner!
COMMENTARY	19'	CHANCE!!! How did they not score there? The Oranje break from a Senegal corner and Bergwijn frees up Berghuis into space. He passes left to De Jong, who has time and space to shoot, but takes far too many touches and is dispossessed in the box!
COMMENTARY	17'	WIDE!!! Gakpo's cross hangs at the back post, where Blind arrives late. His downward header looks a good one, but bounces just wide of the left-hand post!
COMMENTARY	9'	OVER!!! An initially poor touch becomes a clever turn from Sarr, who tries his luck from the edge of the box and loops the ball just over the crossbar!
COMMENTARY	4'	CHANCE!! A flick forward towards Gakpo commits Mendy to the PSV forward, and he's in no-man's land as Gakpo squares to Bergwijn, but it's blocked and cleared by the Senegalese defence!
INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	This will be the first ever encounter between Senegal and the Netherlands. The Dutch are unbeaten against African opposition at the FIFA World Cup (W3 D1), whilst Senegal have never tasted defeat when facing European opposition in the group phase of the competition (W2 D1).	2	The Netherlands are unbeaten in their last eight opening matches at the FIFA World Cup (W6 D2), whilst Senegal have won both of their openers in the tournament (1-0 v France in 2002, 2-1 v Poland in 2018).	3	None of Senegal’s eight matches at the FIFA World Cup have ended goalless. Their only clean sheet dates back to their first ever match in the competition, in May 2002 against France (1-0).	4	This is Senegal’s third appearance at the FIFA World Cup. The Africa Cup of Nations defending champions reached the quarter-finals in 2002 before being knocked out in the group stages in 2018.	5	The Netherlands have won 11 of their last 14 matches at the FIFA World Cup, penalty shoot-outs excluded (D2 L1). Their only defeat in that time was the 2010 final against Spain (0-1 after extra-time), while, their last defeat in a group game was back in 1994 against Belgium (0-1).
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	The Netherlands’ five-man backline features some big names, including captain Virgil van Dijk, who is making his first ever appearance at a major tournament for the Dutch. Behind him, goalkeeper Andries Noppert is making his international debut, and what a stage on which to do so!
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Senegal have been dealt a major, major blow ahead of the tournament, with their all-time top scorer, talisman, and a legend of African football absent, in the form of Sadio Mane. The Bayern Munich forward was ruled out with a fibula injury with the tournament just weeks away, and he’ll unfortunately miss the entirety of it, with Krepin Diatta starting in his place up front.
