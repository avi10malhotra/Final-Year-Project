INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	Argentina have reached the World Cup final for the sixth time, doing so in two of the last three editions of the competition (also in 2014) – only Germany (8) have reached more finals in the competition than Argentina (6 – level with Italy and Brazil).	2	Argentina are just the second team in World Cup history to win two different semi-finals by a 3+ goal margin (also Germany), with Argentina also winning 6-1 versus USA in 1930. This was the biggest World Cup semi-final victory while keeping a clean sheet.	3	Since the 1966 edition, only Netherlands (1 vs Argentina in 2014) have landed fewer shots on target in a World Cup semi-final than Croatia against Argentina tonight (2).
COMMENTARY	Post Match	With what was ultimately a comfortable victory, Argentina sweep into the World Cup final by seizing a crucial two-goal advantage during a few short minutes in the first half. Some vintage Messi magic opened up Croatia again after the interval; allowing partner Alvarez to strike once more, and the Albiceleste are set to feature in another global final - only eight years after their last. Led by Modric - who was somewhat subdued today - the Croatians bow out after yet another spirited run to the latter stages, and they are consigned to contesting third place at the weekend.

Messi dazzles Gvardiol on the right, hanging determinedly onto the ball before weaving his way to the byline.

YELLOW CARD	68'	Cristian Romero	Argentina · Defender #13	Follwing a crunching challenge from behind on Petkovic, near the halfway line, Romero is the latest player to see yellow.

COMMENTARY	Half-time	Following a tightly-contested first half-hour, Argentina's breakthrough via the penalty spot opened up this semi-final, and as Croatia flooded forward in search of a quick response they were punished by Alvarez's goal on the counter. The young forward also won the penalty which led to Messi's opener, which saw the Albiceleste skipper become his nation's leading scorer in World Cup finals - and in emphatic style. The Croatians may feel hard done by, but now have a mountain to climb if they are to make a second successive World Cup final.


COMMENTARY	42'	SUPER STOP! Reacting sharply to parry away a goalbound header from Mac Allister, Livakovic earns partial redemption for his eariler error, as he keeps Croatia's deficit down to two! It was an excellent effort from the Brighton midfielder, following a corner, and his team-mates can barely believe it didn't sneak into the bottom corner!

GOOOAAALLL!!!	34'	Argentina	1	-	0	Croatia	Lionel Messi	Argentina · Striker #10	Penalty Goal	ARGENTINA LEAD! Messi is the man for the big moment again, as the Argentina skipper steps up to the spot and sweeps his penalty into the top-right corner, evading the despairing dive of Livakovic! There was no stopping that! The South American champions lead 1-0 in this World Cup semi-final!

INSIGHTS	18'	Lionel Messi has now scored 11 goals at the World Cup, the most of any Argentina player in the competition’s history
INSIGHTS	0'	Rodrigo De Paul and Leandro Paredes are making their 50th appearances for Argentina tonight.
INSIGHTS	0'	Lionel Messi is set to make his 25th World Cup appearance this evening against Croatia, equalling Germany’s Lothar Matthäus as the joint most capped player in the competition’s history.

INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	This is the third World Cup meeting between Argentina and Croatia, and first in the knockout stages. Argentina won 1-0 in 1998, before Croatia's 3-0 win in the 2018 edition in Russia.	2	Argentina are looking to reach the World Cup final for the sixth time, a figure bettered only by Germany (8). They've never been eliminated at the semi-final stage before, most recently beating the Netherlands in 2014.	3	Croatia were losing finalists in 2018, and could become the fourth European nation to reach consecutive World Cup finals after Italy (1934, 1938), Netherlands (1974, 1978) and Germany (1982, 1986, 1990).	4	Following their penalty shootout victory against Brazil in the quarter-final, Croatia could become just the second side to eliminate both Brazil and Argentina from the knockout stages of the same World Cup, after Germany in 2014.	5	Argentina have won just one of their last seven World Cup games against European sides (D3 L3), beating Poland 2-0 in the group stages this year. However, two of those three draws have resulted in penalty shootout victories.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Croatia name an unchanged team today, so Pasalic retains his place in support of Kramaric - the latter holding off the challenge of extra-time hero Petkovic to start. A much-lauded midfield triumvirate again features Brozovic, Kovacic and captain Modric.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Following a fiery quarter-final clash on Friday, Argentina full-backs Montiel and Acuna are both suspended today, and in the latter's absence Tagliafico comes in on the left side of a back four. Lionel Scaloni makes one more change to the XI which started his side's quarter-final win over the Netherlands, as Paredes replaces Lisandro Martinez, in order to combat Croatia's masterful midfield.
