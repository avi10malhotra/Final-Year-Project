INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	Qatar have become the first host nation to lose their opening game at that edition of the World Cup (W16 D6 before today).	2	Ecuador have kept a clean sheet in each of their last seven matches in all competitions (W3 D4), with Argentina's Julián Álvarez the last player to score against them back in March.	3	Ecuador scored twice in the first half of a World Cup match for the first time. This is the second time in their four appearances at the World Cup they've won their opening match, with the other also being 2-0 (against Poland in 2006).
COMMENTARY	Post Match	Ecuador secure a 2-0 victory over Qatar in the first match of the 2022 World Cup at the Al Bayt Stadium. El Tri saw a third-minute header from Enner Valencia disallowed for offside by VAR, but Valencia soon got his side up and running scoring from the penalty spot after he was fouled by Saad Al Sheeb. The Ecuador captain then extended his side's lead with a brilliant header from Angel Preciado's cross. Almoez Ali missed Qatar's best chance of the game before the interval, heading wide from close range. Ecuador saw out the result in the second half with ease to notch a victory and three vital points in Group A.

Valencia then notched his second with a brilliant header from Angel Preciado's cross to put his team in command.
COMMENTARY	45+5'	CHANCE! ALMOEZ ALI HAS TO SCORE! Al Haydos fires a cross into the box from the right flank for an unmarked Almoez Ali, but the forward glances his header wide of the target from six yards. Qatar should be back in the game.
