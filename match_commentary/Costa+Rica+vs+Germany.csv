INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	Germany have been eliminated from the group stages at consecutive World Cups (also 2018), after they had progressed from the first round group stage in each of their 16 previous such appearances at the tournament.	2	Germany have failed to keep a clean sheet in their last 12 matches at major tournaments (World Cups + Euros), further extending their longest such streak.	3	Costa Rica have scored more World Cup goals against Germany (4) than they have versus any other side, surpassing the three they’d scored against Uruguay in 2014. At the other end, against no side have they shipped more goals at the World Cup than they have versus Germany (8 – level with Brazil).
COMMENTARY	Post Match	Germany are out of the World Cup despite coming from behind to beat Costa Rica thanks to a brace from substitute Havertz. Ahead early on through a Gnabry header, Costa Rica turned the score in their favour in the second half. First, it was Tejeda who slammed the ball into the bottom corner, getting on the end of a rebound after Neuer fumbled Waston’s header. Suarez’s side briefly moved above Spain and into second when Vargas' flick was directed into the net by Neuer, before Havertz hit back with a quick response. Germany were behind for just three minutes, with the Chelsea man directing Fullkrug’s pass beyond Navas before slamming Gnabry’s inviting cross past the Costa Rican goalkeeper. With an assist to his name, Fullkrug then scored Germany’s fourth to confirm the victory, striking the ball in from close range after Sane laid it into his path. It was first disallowed for offside before VAR intervened to give the goal.

COMMENTARY	Half-time	Gnabry scored the only goal in the first half as a dominant Germany lead against Costa Rica. Up against a resilient defence, Germany should have taken the lead through Muller, who ran free in the box before heading the ball wide. Instead, it was Gnabry who broke the deadlock. Musiala, who has been heavily involved in every attack, slid a pass down the left to Raum who went hurtling forward. The left-back then delivered a perfect cross, finding Gnabry who headered it past Navas. With just 29.9 per cent of possession, Costa Rica almost found an unlikely equaliser with their only shot of the opening 45 minutes. The hero against Japan, Fuller dispossessed Rudiger before seeing a powerful effort pushed over by Neuer.
INSIGHTS	45'	Costa Rica have had the fewest shots on target at World Cup 2022, Keysher Fuller's in the first half was just their second.
COMMENTARY	42'	OVER! Huge chance for Costa Rica to equalise. Rudiger fumbles his pass back to Neuer, allowing Fuller to run one-on-one with the goalkeeper. He smashes his effort down the centre of the goal from close range, with Neuer pushing it over.
COMMENTARY	39'	WIDE! Gnabry misses the target. Using Waston and Borges as sight blockers for Navas, he curls the ball around the right post from inside the box.
INSIGHTS	21'	Serge Gnabry has been directly involved in 29 goals in 39 appearances for Germany in all competitions, scoring his 21st goal tonight (also assisting 8 more).
INSIGHTS	20'	Serge Gnabry’s 21st goal for Germany was his first international goal scored with his head. He is the first German to score a headed goal at the World Cup since Mats Hummels in 2014 vs. France
GOOOAAALLL!!!	10'	Costa Rica	0	-	1	Germany	Serge Gnabry	Germany · Midfielder #10	Asst: D. Raum	GOAAALLLL! GNABRY SCORES! 1-0 GERMANY! This time, Germany score. Musiala runs forward with the ball, sliding it down the left to Raum. Looking for men in the middle, Gnabry latches onto the cross, heading it into the corner past Navas. Gnabry did not celebrate, picking up the ball and running back to his own half. Germany may have to win by two goals to finish in the top two positions of Group E.
COMMENTARY	2'	SAVE! Navas makes the first save of the night. From the left, Musiala cuts inside before unleashing a shot from the edge of the box. Going low, his effort is pushed away for a corner.

INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	This is the second ever meeting between Germany and Costa Rica, with the Germans winning 4-2 in the opening match of the 2006 FIFA World Cup previously.	2	Germany have won six of their eight FIFA World Cup matches against CONCACAF nations (D1 L1), though their only defeat in this run was in their last such match against Mexico in 2018.	3	Costa Rica have won just one of their last 11 FIFA World Cup games against European nations (D5 L5), recording a 1-0 win over Italy in the 2014 edition. Indeed, six of Costa Rica’s World Cup 2022 squad featured in the win against Italy (Celso Borges, Bryan Ruiz, Joel Campbell, Keylor Navas, Yeltsin Tejeda, Óscar Duarte).	4	Following their 1-0 win against Japan on matchday two, Costa Rica could win consecutive World Cup matches for only the second time (in 2014 vs Uruguay and Italy), while they’ve only recorded consecutive clean sheets in the competition on one previous occasion (in 2014 vs Italy and England).	5	Germany had 35.9% possession against Spain on matchday two, their lowest ever share in a World Cup game since 1966, breaking their previous record (39%), set in 1986 against Morocco. Indeed, Germany have failed to win their first two group stage matches at a single World Cup for the first time in their history.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	As for Germany, Flick makes one alteration to the team that drew with Spain. Kehrer is replaced by Sane, causing the team to shuffle. With the West Ham defender playing at right-back in the previous match, Kimmich drops from the midfield into the vacant space. Partnering with Goretzka against Spain, Gundogan takes his place, moving into a deeper role after playing as an attacking midfielder. Finally, Musiala moves from the left wing into the centre, behind Muller, with Sane on the left of the German attack.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Costa Rica make three changes to the team that beat Japan last time out. Yellow carded in the first two matches; the suspended Francisco Calvo is replaced by Vargas in the defence. In the attack, Aguilera comes in for Torres on the right, with Venegas leading the line instead of Contreras.
