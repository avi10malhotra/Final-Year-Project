INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	France have won five consecutive games at the World Cup, their joint-longest winning run at the tournament, having also won five in a row from 1986 to 1998.	2	Australia have lost 11 of their 17 games at the World Cup (65%), the joint-highest ratio by any nation to play 10+ matches at the competition (Saudi Arabia also 65%).	3	France were the first reigning champion to win their opening game of a World Cup tournament since Brazil in 2006, while this was the biggest ever MD1 win by a reigning champion to kick-off a World Cup campaign.
COMMENTARY	Post Match	France get their World Cup defence off to a winning start, easily beating Australia! Les Bleus got caught cold by Goodwin's early goal, the fastest at this World Cup so far, but weren't fazed as they then proceeded to score four goals without reply. Giroud will be pleased with his double, while Mbappe was magnificent as ever.

YELLOW CARD	90+4'	Aaron Mooy	Australia · Midfielder #13	Mooy's booked for a silly, late tackle on Theo Hernandez. It's a tired challenge.
COMMENTARY	90'	France win another corner and nearly grab a fifth goal! Konate nods it down into the turf and back up towards goal. Ryan watches the situation unfold and dives to his left to deny the centre-back. It's just as well. Another goal would be cruel on Australia.

GOOOAAALLL!!!	71'	France	4	-	1	Australia	Olivier Giroud	France · Striker #9	Asst: K. Mbappe	GOAL! FRANCE 4-1 AUSTRALIA! Giroud grabs his second goal of the game, planting Mbappe's left-wing cross into the far bottom corner with his head. He's tied with Thierry Henry as France's top goalscorer!
GOOOAAALLL!!!	68'	France	3	-	1	Australia	Kylian Mbappé	France · Midfielder #10	Asst: O. Dembélé	GOAL! FRANCE 3-1 AUSTRALIA! Mbappe has given France a two-goal cushion! The breakout star of the last World Cup stays in the box after a wayward cross. Dembele picks up the pieces and floats the ball back in for the PSG man to head in off the post.
COMMENTARY	67'	Chance for France! Theo Hernandez plays an excellent one-two with Mbappe and cuts the ball back. Mbappe leaves it for Griezmann, whose shot is cleared off the line! Australia are hanging on.
SUBSTITUTION	56'	IN	Jason Cummings	Australia · Striker #25	OUT	Mitchell Duke	Australia · Striker #15	The booked Duke gets substituted. The Central Coast Mariners striker Cummings takes his place up front for Australia.
YELLOW CARD	55'	Mitchell Duke	Australia · Striker #15	Duke overruns with the ball, scything down Dembele as he attempts to recover it. He's shown the game's first yellow card.
COMMENTARY	49'	Theo Hernandez is causing Australia all sorts of problems! France's left-back first finds Tchouameni who blasts into a crowd of bodies. The substitute then comes back to deliver another excellent cross and Giroud's bicycle kick bounces off target!
COMMENTARY	Half-time	When Goodwin put Australia 1-0 up early on, it felt like we might have another shock on our hands. France soon got into gear, scoring twice in five minutes through Rabiot and Giroud, and they go in at half-time with a deserved lead. This isn't over yet though, not by a long chalk. More to come after the break!
COMMENTARY	45+2'	Irvine hits the post! The St. Pauli midfielder finds himself with a free header in the box and nods back across goal. It kisses the left-hand upright and bounces back into play.
COMMENTARY	45'	It should be 3-1 France! They're cutting Australia open at will. Griezmann ghosts in off the right and dinks the ball towards Mbappe in the centre. Mbappe makes contact with it but can't stop his touch from whizzing over the crossbar.
COMMENTARY	43'	France almost extend their lead! Mbappe shows good awareness to find Griezmann with another cheeky backheel. The Atletico Madrid man's low roller from the edge of the box isn't too far wide of the mark.
INSIGHTS	42'	Having scored just one goal in his first 27 appearances for France, Adrien Rabiot has since scored two in his last three international games.
COMMENTARY	36'	Dembele burns past Behich down the right and fires a cross in. Mbappe blasts first-time against a defender and Giroud fires over! France have fully found their rhythm now.
INSIGHTS	35'	Craig Goodwin's goal in the ninth minute was Australia's quickest in a World Cup match, and indeed the first time they've scored in the opening 10 minutes in the tournament.
INSIGHTS	32'	Olivier Giroud is the oldest goalscorer (36y 53d) for a European nation at the World Cup (excl. own goals) since Georges Bregy for Switzerland v USA in 1994 (36y 152d).
GOOOAAALLL!!!	32'	France	2	-	1	Australia	Olivier Giroud	France · Striker #9	Asst: A. Rabiot	GOAL! FRANCE 2-1 AUSTRALIA! It's a simple but beautiful goal. Giroud peels off his marker in the centre of the box and fires Rabiot's cutback into an empty net. That's two goals in five minutes for France!
INSIGHTS	30'	France have conceded the opening goal in a World Cup match for the first time since the 2014 quarter-final (v Germany).
GOOOAAALLL!!!	27'	France	1	-	1	Australia	Adrien Rabiot	France · Midfielder #14	Asst: T. Hernández	GOAL! FRANCE 1-1 AUSTRALIA! France have equalised through Rabiot! Australia defend the corner but switch off in the second phase. Theo Hernandez swings the ball back into the box and Rabiot plants a header past Ryan!
COMMENTARY	22'	Duke has no passing options so lets rip with his right foot from range. The ball swerves just wide of the right-hand post. Lloris wasn't keeping that out if it had been on target.
INSIGHTS	17'	Olivier Giroud (36y 53d) and Hugo Lloris (35y 331d) today become the oldest two players to play for France in a World Cup match, both surpassing Fabien Barthez in 2006 (35y 11d).
SUBSTITUTION	13'	IN	Theo Hernández	France · Defender #22	OUT	Lucas Hernandez	France · Defender #21	Lucas Hernandez gets substituted off. His brother Theo takes his place at left-back for France.
COMMENTARY	12'	Lucas Hernandez is escorted off the pitch. It's clear he'll play no further part here sadly. His knee seems to be the issue.
GOOOAAALLL!!!	9'	France	0	-	1	Australia	Craig Goodwin	Australia · Midfielder #23	Asst: M. Leckie	GOAL! FRANCE 0-1 AUSTRALIA! Souttar's crossfield pass is taken down by Leckie, who leaves Lucas Hernandez down on the turf. The winger fizzes a low cross to the far post where Goodwin arrives to arrow high into the net!
INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	France came out victorious in their only previous FIFA World Cup encounter with Australia, winning 2-1 in their opening fixture of the 2018 edition. The match produced two penalties – both converted – and an own goal.	2	Australia’s only victory against France came in the 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup – they won 1-0 in Daegu, South Korea, thanks to a Clayton Zane goal. The other four meetings produced three French victories and a draw.	3	France have qualified for their 16th FIFA World Cup. It’s their seventh appearance in a row, their longest ever run of participations.	4	Since 1998, France have reached the final of the FIFA World Cup in three of the six editions (1998, 2006, 2018), more than any other nation in this time.	5	Current holders France will attempt to become the third team to win back-to-back FIFA World Cups after Italy (1934-1938) and Brazil (1958-1962). However, the last three World Cup defending champions have been knocked out in the group stages (Italy 2010, Spain 2014, Germany 2018).
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Australia start with three different players from the second leg of their qualification play-off against Peru. Souttar, McGree and Goodwin are given opportunities to impress.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Didier Deschamps names a France side that lines up in a back four. There are five changes to the team from their 2-0 defeat to Denmark in the UEFA Nations League in September. Giroud and Lloris become the oldest two players to play for Les Bleus in a World Cup match at 36 and 35 years old respectively.
