INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	Netherlands have now avoided defeat in each of their last 15 World Cup group games (W11 D4), only Germany between 1990 and 2010 and Brazil currently (both 16) have enjoyed longer such runs. Indeed, since reaching the final in 2010, they have played more games at the World Cup without suffering a defeat (9) than any other side.	2	Ecuador have now gone unbeaten in four consecutive World Cup games for the first time in their history (W2 D2), while it’s just the second time they have avoided defeat in their opening two games of a World Cup after 2006 - the only time they’ve reached the knockout stages.	3	Netherlands failed to win a World Cup match in which they opened the scoring for the first time since a 2-2 draw with Mexico in 1998, having gone two goals ahead on that occasion.
INSIGHTS	90+7'	Frenkie de Jong (9) has made more tackles than any other player at the 2022 World Cup, with seven of those coming in this game.
INSIGHTS	90+7'	Netherlands have only attempted two shots in this match - 10 fewer than their opponents Ecuador (12). They've also only recorded six touches in the opposition box, compared to 19 for Ecuador.
COMMENTARY	90+1'	CHANCE!!! Ecuador go close once more!! Noppert takes too long to clear the ball and his kick is charged down by Rodriguez, and the deflection nearly sends the ball into the unguarded net!
SUBSTITUTION	90'	IN	Romario Ibarra	Ecuador · Midfielder #10	OUT	Gonzalo Plata	Ecuador · Midfielder #19	Plata is also taken off, with the forward line changing once more with the introduction of Romario Ibarra.
SUBSTITUTION	90'	IN	Kevin Rodríguez	Ecuador · Midfielder #26	OUT	Enner Valencia	Ecuador · Midfielder #13	Valencia is taken off via stretcher, with Kevin Rodriguez sent on to replace the Ecuador talisman.
SUBSTITUTION	80'	IN	Wout Weghorst	Netherlands · Striker #19	OUT	Cody Gakpo	Netherlands · Striker #8	More changes coming for the Dutch, as the goalscorer Gakpo is replaced by Besiktas' on-loan Burnley forward Wout Weghorst.
SUBSTITUTION	79'	IN	Marten de Roon	Netherlands · Midfielder #15	OUT	Teun Koopmeiners	Netherlands · Midfielder #20	Koopmeiners also comes off, and is replaced in the middle of the park by his Atalanta teammate Marten de Roon.
SUBSTITUTION	74'	IN	Jeremy Sarmiento	Ecuador · Striker #16	OUT	Michael Estrada	Ecuador · Striker #11	Estrada comes off in Ecuador's first alteration, and another Brighton player, Jeremy Sarmiento, replaces him in the forward line.
COMMENTARY	73'	WIDE!!! Depay's flick puts Gakpo through on goal, and the goalscorer chips Galindez. The ball looks to be creeping into the net, but bounces wide of the far post as the flag goes up!
SUBSTITUTION	69'	IN	Steven Berghuis	Netherlands · Striker #11	OUT	Davy Klaassen	Netherlands · Midfielder #14	The Oranje make their second change, with Klaassen withdrawn for Steven Berghuis.
COMMENTARY	64'	CHANCE! Hincapie's long clearance finds Valencia, who engages two before squaring into the middle. Plata arrives late and looks the place the ball in the corner, but scuffs his finish and the ball rolls into Noppert's gloves!
COMMENTARY	61'	Valencia has attempted five shots so far, the most of anyone in the game, and the most the Fenerbahce striker has attempted in any World Cup match across his career.
COMMENTARY	59'	OFF THE BAR!!! What a chance for Ecuador!!! Preciado's cross for Valencia is fired goalwards, but Van Dijk gets in the way. Plata follows in to smash it back in, and the ball cannons off the bar and out again!
YELLOW CARD	57'	Sebas Méndez	Ecuador · Midfielder #20	Mendez arrives late and catch Depay as he releases the ball, with the unnecessary challenge resulting in a yellow card for the Ecuador midfielder.
INSIGHTS	52'	Enner Valencia has scored each of Ecuador's last six goals at the World Cup. He is just the fourth player ever to score six consecutive goals for a nation in the competition, along with Eusébio for Portugal in 1966, Paolo Rossi for Italy in 1982 and Oleg Salenko for Russia in 1994.
GOOOAAALLL!!!	49'	Netherlands	1	-	1	Ecuador	Enner Valencia	Ecuador · Midfielder #13	GOOOOAAAALLLL!!!! And this time it WILL count!!! Estupinan is found in open space down the left and drills a low shot from the edge of the box. He gets down well and parries it, but Valencia is on hand to stab the ball into back of the net to make it 1-1! They were denied by the flag right at the end of the first half, but Ake plays Valencia onside here, meaning they do get their just reward right at the start of the second!
SUBSTITUTION	46'	IN	Memphis Depay	Netherlands · Striker #10	OUT	Steven Bergwijn	Netherlands · Striker #7	The Netherlands make one half-time change, with Bergwijn replaced by Memphis Depay up front for the Oranje.
INSIGHTS	Half-time	Netherlands have only failed to win two of their previous 17 World Cup games when leading at half time (D2), last surrendering a half time lead in 1998 v Mexico (2-2).
INSIGHTS	Half-time	Netherlands scored from their only shot of the first half. They were the first side to score from their only shot of the first half in a World Cup group game since New Zealand against Italy in 2010.
COMMENTARY	Half-time	The first half ends, with Ecuador's players incensed that they were denied an equaliser there! They arguably did deserve an equaliser, having created several chances towards the back end of the half. However, Gakpo's opener was a strike worthy of winning any game, as the PSV forward smashed home a peach of a finish after just six minutes. It's been quite nervy since then, with both teams having half-chances here and there, but Ecuador's disallowed goal will hopefully inspire them to find an equaliser sooner rather than later.
COMMENTARY	45+3'	BALL IN THE NET!!! Ecuador look to have equalised, as the headed away corner is blasted back towards goal by Plata. Estupinan turns it goalwards, and the ball bypasses Porozo to beat Noppert and roll into the net! Estupinan wheels away in celebration, but the flag is up against the offside Porozo, who despite not touching the ball is deemed to have acted in the passage of play, meaning the goal will be ruled out!
COMMENTARY	45+2'	BLOCKED!!! Estupinan's cross is aimed towards Valencia, but the captain's header bounces off Ake and goes behind for a corner!
COMMENTARY	32'	SAVED!!! Ecuador counter and the ball is floated wide to Valencia on the left. He cuts inside and lets fly from the edge of the area, which is tipped behind well by Noppert at his near post!
COMMENTARY	28'	CHANCE!!! Valencia glides into the box and evades Timber before squaring to Estrada. He mis-hits his shot and the ball skews wide, with Preciado picking up the pieces to win his side a corner!
COMMENTARY	24'	CHANCE!! Preciado bursts down the right for Ecuador and beats his marker, before crossing into the box. Timber hacks it away, but back come the Tricolors, as Caicedo runs along the left byline before pulling the ball back to Valencia, but the Oranje are again able to clear!
COMMENTARY	11'	CHANCE! Preciado's cross from the right is headed back from the far post by Hincapie, and Valencia strikes a good effort on the half volley which is headed away by Ake!
INSIGHTS	10'	Cody Gakpo's opener was the first goal Ecuador had conceded in 701 minutes across all competitions, with their previous goal conceded being in March against Argentina.
INSIGHTS	8'	Cody Gakpo is only the second player to score in his first two World Cup appearances for the Netherlands, after Memphis Depay in 2014.
GOOOAAALLL!!!	6'	Netherlands	1	-	0	Ecuador	Cody Gakpo	Netherlands · Striker #8	Asst: D. Klaassen	GOOOOOAAAALLL!!!! What an early strike that is!!! Klaassen does well to rein in a deflected pass, before feeding Gakpo. He takes one step to the left before shooting with his left foot, and rifling the ball straight into the top corner! That's his second of the tournament, and what a way to get it as he puts the Oranje 1-0 up!
INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	This is only the third meeting between the Netherlands and Ecuador, with the previous two coming in friendlies in March 2006 (1-0 win for Netherlands) and May 2014 (1-1 draw).	2	The Netherlands have lost just two of their 14 FIFA World Cup matches against South American opponents (W8 D4), losing the 1978 final against Argentina, and a quarter-final meeting with Brazil in 1994.	3	Ecuador have won just two of their seven FIFA World Cup meetings with European sides (D1 L4), beating Croatia in 2002 and Poland in 2006.	4	Ecuador have kept a clean sheet in each of their last seven matches in all competitions (W3 D4), with Argentina's Julián Álvarez the last player to score against them back in March.	5	Netherlands have kept a clean sheet in each of their last four World Cup games, their longest ever run in the competition. The last nation to keep five in a row were Switzerland, between 2006 and 2010.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Enner Valencia had the ball in the net three times against Qatar, but the first was ruled out, thanks to a very borderline offside call from VAR. The Fenerbahce forward starts this game on the left flank though, with Michael Estrada leading the line in a 5-4-1 formation, as La Tricolors primarily look to keep the Dutch at bay.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Cody Gakpo was somewhat limited by his wide right position for much of the game against Senegal, but as soon as he moved into the centre, he headed in the opener. He’ll therefore start through the middle alongside Steve Bergwijn, with the two supported by Davy Klaassen in the hole, who also scored in the dying minutes last time out.
