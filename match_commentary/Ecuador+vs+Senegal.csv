INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	Senegal became the first African nation to beat a South American side at the World Cup since Cameroon v Colombia in 1990, ending a 21-game winless run (D4 L17).	2	Senegal have won successive World Cup games for the very first time. Meanwhile, this tournament is the first time that they have finished a World Cup group stage with six points (5 in 2002 was their previous best total).	3	Ecuador have failed to make it past the group stage of the World Cup in three of their four appearances in the competition, while this was their first defeat in the tournament in five matches (W2 D2).
COMMENTARY	Post Match	Senegal are through to the knockout stages for the first time since 2002 with a 2-1 win over Ecuador. Sarr won a penalty just before the break when Hincapie crashed into him, and he coolly stepped up to slot it home. Ecuador pushed after the break and equalised from a corner when Caicedo tapped in from close range, but just two and a half minutes later, Senegal took the lead again. Idrissa Gueye's free-kick deflected to Koulibaly and the captain volleyed in the winner to send his side through.

COMMENTARY	82'	CLOSE! A loose touch from Hincapie bounces kindly for Dieng, and he spins away from Torres before whipping a shot towards the near post. It's always curling away though and it flies wide.
COMMENTARY	77'	SAVE! It's a clever bit of play from Sarmiento as he dribbles past two defenders on the right to clip it into the far post. Preciado nods it into Plata, who gets it out of his feet before drilling it straight at Mendy.

INSIGHTS	70'	There were just 150 seconds separating Moises Caicedo's equaliser and Kalidou Koulibaly's goal to put Senegal back in front.
GOOOAAALLL!!!	70'	Ecuador	1	-	2	Senegal	Kalidou Koulibaly	Senegal · Defender #3	KOULIBALY SCORES! And just like that, Senegal are back in front!

GOOOAAALLL!!!	67'	Ecuador	1	-	1	Senegal	Moisés Caicedo	Ecuador · Midfielder #23	Asst: F. Torres	CAICEDO EQUALISES! It's a huge goal for Ecuador! It's a great delivery from Plata on the corner and Torres rises highest to flick it on in the middle of the crowded box. Caicedo is unmarked at the far post, and is being played onside by the man on the line, and he slots it into the back of the net. 1-1!
YELLOW CARD	66'	Idrissa Gueye	Senegal · Midfielder #5	Idrissa Gueye clumsily crashes into Preciado, and it's a costly challenge as it results in a booking that will see him miss the next game if Senegal get through.

COMMENTARY	Half-time	Sarr's penalty gives Senegal a 1-0 lead over Ecuador at half-time. It's a deserved lead for the African side, who pushed for a goal from the first whistle. Idrissa Gueye and Ndiaye both sent chances wide before Senegal were awarded a late penalty when Hincapie crashed into Sarr. He stepped up to take the resulting spot-kick and coolly slotted it home.

GOOOAAALLL!!!	44'	Ecuador	0	-	1	Senegal	Ismaïla Sarr	Senegal · Midfielder #18	Penalty Goal	SARR SCORES! It's cool as you like from the man that won the penalty! He takes a slow run-up to the spot, stuttering it as he stares down the goalkeeper. He coolly slots it into the bottom right corner, leaving Galindez static in the middle of his line. 1-0 Senegal!
COMMENTARY	42'	PENALTY TO SENEGAL! Preciado is beaten by the bounce and Sarr is chasing the ball into the box. He knocks it on with a clever first touch and Hincapie crashes into him with a late challenge. The referee has no doubts as he points straight to the spot.
INSIGHTS	41'	Ecuador forward Michael Estrada is the only player yet to complete a pass in this match, with none his five pass attempts being successful.
COMMENTARY	40'	Sarr stretches to keep hold of the ball and just catches Caicedo's foot in the process. The midfielder stayed down to receive treatment, but he's able to carry on.
INSIGHTS	30'	Ecuador have faced six shots against Senegal in this match, just one fewer than they did in the entirety of their games against Qatar and the Netherlands combined (7).
COMMENTARY	24'	CHANCE! It's great work from Sarr to keep the ball in play after leaving Preciado on the floor, and he cuts inside from the left before having a go. He curls it towards the far top corner, but a deflection helps it wide.
COMMENTARY	20'	It's a heavy tackle from Sarr on Preciado, and the right-back has stayed down. He needs treatment after twisting his knee during the collision, but he'll be carrying on for now.
COMMENTARY	12'	CLOSE! Ecuador are caught out again here and Senegal are getting a lot of joy down their right side. Ndiaye cuts inside, leaving Estupinan behind and he tries to curl his shot into the far top corner, but it's just wide.
COMMENTARY	9'	CHANCE! Senegal have made a really bright start and Sabaly intercepts a clearance before cutting inside from the right before sliding it to Dia on the penalty spot. He drags at the shot though, sending it wide of the far post.
COMMENTARY	3'	GREAT CHANCE! Jakobs gets in front of Preciado before squaring it across the box to the far post. Idrissa Gueye is unmarked as he runs onto it, but he fires his first-time shot wide.

INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	Senegal have won both of their previous meetings with Ecuador in all competitions, winning friendly matches in May 2002 (1-0) and December 2005 (2-1).	2	This is Ecuador’s first ever FIFA World Cup match against an African nation. Meanwhile, Senegal are winless in both of their previous World Cup games against South American sides, with both of these coming in the final group game of a tournament (3-3 vs Uruguay in 2002, 0-1 vs Colombia in 2018).	3	If they avoid defeat, Ecuador will qualify for the knockout stages of the World Cup for the second time in their history, also doing so in 2006. It would also be the first time they’ve gone through an entire group stage unbeaten.	4	Senegal won 3-1 against Qatar in their last World Cup match and are looking for consecutive wins in the competition for the first time. They last won two games in a single tournament in 2002 (one group stage match + the second round match).	5	Senegal go into MD3 with the chance to qualify for the knockout stages of the World Cup for the first time since 2002 under Bruno Metsu. Current manager Aliou Cisse played in four of their five matches at that tournament.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Aliou Cisse makes three changes to the side that beat Qatar last time out. Ciss, Pape Gueye and Ndiaye are all brought in, and Sarr makes his 50th appearance for Senegal. Nampalys Mendy, Diatta and Diedhiou start on the bench.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Gustavo Alfaro makes just two changes from the draw with Netherlands on Friday, and the big news is that their star man, Valencia, is fit to start after being stretchered off in that game. Franco and Gruezo both come in. Porozo drops to the bench, while Sebas Mendez is suspended.
