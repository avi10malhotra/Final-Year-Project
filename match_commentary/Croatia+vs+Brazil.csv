INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	Croatia have reached at least the last four of the World Cup on all three occasions that they have made it out of the group stages (1998, 2018 and 2022).	2	Brazil have been eliminated from four of their last five World Cup quarter-finals. In addition, Brazil have been eliminated from each of their last six World Cup knockout stage games against European nations since a 2-0 victory over Germany in the 2002 final.	3	Neymar's opening goal means that he has equaled Pelé’s record as Brazil’s all-time top scorer (77). Furthermore, Neymar has scored three goals in six World Cup appearances against European nations, with all three coming against Croatia (2 in 2014 and today).
COMMENTARY	Post Match	Croatia are through to the World Cup semi-finals for the second tournament in a row courtesy of a 4-2 victory over Brazil on penalties after their quarter-final clash finished 1-1. Neymar looked to have put the Selecao on the path to the last four with a brilliant goal to break the deadlock in stoppage time in the first half of extra time. However, Bruno Petkovic equalised with a deflected effort to keep Croatia alive in the second half of extra time. Dominik Livakovic then performed his magic again to deny Rodrygo Silva from the penalty spot, while Zlatko Dalic's men were perfect piling the pressure on Marquinhos to score. The defender struck the post with a vital kick, sending Croatia through and Brazil home yet again at the quarter-final stage.
INSIGHTS	Penalty Shootout	Croatia have won all three of their previous World Cup penalty shootouts, while Brazil have won 3/4 of theirs, failing only v France in 1986.

COMMENTARY	Half-time	It is goalless at the break in the World Cup quarter-final clash between Croatia and Brazil. Neither side has threatened to break the deadlock outside of a couple of half-chances for Brazil through Vinicius Junior and Neymar. Croatia have been resilient at the back and have prevented the Selecao from finding their rhythm. Zlatko Dalic will be pretty pleased with his team's effort in the first half.

INSIGHTS	0'	In Brazil's Thiago Silva (38) and Croatia's Luka Modric (37), this is the first knockout stage game at the World Cup to see both starting XIs contain a player aged 37+ since the 1958 semi-final between Germany (Fritz Walter, 37) and Sweden (Gunnar Gren, 37).
INSIGHTS	0'	Luka Modric is making his 30th major tournament appearance (17 World Cup, 13 EUROs), the first player to hit that total for Croatia.
INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	Brazil have never lost in four previous meetings with Croatia in all competitions (W3 D1), with this their first meeting since a 2-0 friendly win in June 2018.	2	Croatia have lost four of their five World Cup games against South American sides, with the exception being a 3-0 win over Argentina in 2018. Two of those four defeats have been against Brazil – 1-0 in 2006 and 3-1 in 2014 (both group stages).	3	Since beating Germany 2-0 in the final in 2002, Brazil have lost each of their last five World Cup knockout stage games against European nations, including three quarter-final ties in that run (France in 2006, Netherlands in 2010 and Belgium in 2018).	4	In a run going back to EURO 2008, seven of Croatia's last eight knockout stage games at major tournaments (World Cup and Euro) have gone to extra time, with the exception being the 2018 World Cup final. They've progressed from all four such games at the World Cup, three via penalty shootout.	5	Brazil are looking to reach the World Cup semi-final for the ninth time, with only Germany (12) doing so more often. Meanwhile, Croatia have reached at least the last four of the competition on both previous occasions they've made it out of the group stages (1998 and 2018).
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Tite names an unchanged team from the side that hammered South Korea 4-1 in the last round. Richarlison continues to lead the line supported by Neymar, Vinicius and Raphinha. Militao and Danilo continue in the full-back positions. Paqueta and Casemiro sit in front of the back four, with Thiago Silva and Marquinhos anchoring the defence.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Croatia have made two changes to their side that started the round of-16 clash against Japan. Sosa returns to left-back after recovering from an illness and replaces Barisic, who drops to the bench. Pasalic comes into the line-up as he replaces Petkovic in the final third.
