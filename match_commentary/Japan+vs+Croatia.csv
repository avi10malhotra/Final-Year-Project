INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	Croatia have progressed from all three of their appearances in the round of 16 at the World Cup, winning on penalties in each of the last two (also Denmark in 2018).	2	Croatia have won all three of their World Cup penalty shootouts (also vs Denmark and Russia in 2018), while the team going second has won the last seven penalty shootouts at the World Cup.	3	Japan have been eliminated from all four of their round of 16 appearances at the World Cup (D2 L2), while they’ve lost both of their penalty shootouts in the competition (also vs Paraguay in 2010).
COMMENTARY	Post Match	Both teams started the game with a lot of energy but as the minutes ticked by, Croatia began to control the game and dictate the pace, which was very slow. Perisic had Croatia's best chance of the half but could not beat Gonda from close range following a mistake from Tomiyasu. Japan found some momentum at the end of the half and made it count after Maeda scored his first goal of the tournament. He reacted quickest to Yoshida's knockdown to give Japan the lead in the 43rd minute. The only highlight in the second half was Perisic's equaliser as if bullet header could not be stopped this time by Gonda. Extra time was quiet and saw a lack of chances other than a deflected effort from Mitoma. Livakovic became the hero in the penalty shootout as he saved three of the four Japan penalties, with only Asano scoring. Pasalic dispatched the winning penalty with Croatia winning the shootout 3-1.

INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	This will be the third World Cup meeting between Japan and Croatia, with Japan winless and goalless in the previous two – a 0-1 defeat in 1998 and a goalless draw in 2006, both in the group stage. Those two matches are Croatia’s only previous World Cup games against an Asian nation.	2	Japan have won both of their 2022 World Cup matches against European nations, 2-1 wins over Spain and Germany in the group stage. They had only won two of their first 10 World Cup matches against European sides before this year (D3 L5).	3	Japan have reached the last 16 of the World Cup for a fourth time, including both of the last two editions. However, they have never progressed from this stage, going out to Turkey in 2002, Paraguay (on penalties) in 2010, and Belgium in 2018. The only Asian nations to reach the World Cup quarter-finals were DPR Korea in 1966 and Korea Republic in 2002.	4	This will be Croatia’s third appearance in the round of 16 at the World Cup, while they progressed from this stage in both previous such instances, beating Romania 1-0 in 1998 and Denmark on penalties in 2018.	5	Croatia have only lost two of their eight knockout stage games at the World Cup (W4 D2), while they also progressed from the two such games that finished as draws on penalties, both in 2018 (v Denmark in the round of 16, Russia in the quarter-final).
