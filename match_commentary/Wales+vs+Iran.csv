INSIGHTS	Half-time	Eight of Iran's 11 World Cup goals have come in the second half of matches (73%), including each of their last six in a row.
COMMENTARY	Half-time	A tense first half ends with the game goalless. With both teams needing a win, it was Wales who had the first chance. Moore poked Roberts’ cross from the right towards the goal, but his effort was pushed away by Hosseini. Four minutes later, Iran thought they had taken the lead. Roberts passed the ball straight to Iran inside the Wales half. Playing a one-two with Azmoun, Gholizadeh ran free inside the box to strike the ball into the net. However, after a VAR check, the goal was ruled out for offside. Bale also had a speculative effort saved, with Azmoun almost getting on the end of Noorollahi’s cross and the end of the half.
YELLOW CARD	45+3'	Joe Rodon	Wales · Defender #6	Clear yellow card for Rodon. He slides into Taremi who was breaking down the left and receives a booking.

COMMENTARY	27'	Azmoun is down and requires treatment. It came after tackling Williams moments after losing the ball under the challenge of Rodon.
COMMENTARY	17'	NO GOAL! After a quick VAR check, the goal is ruled out for offside. Gholizadeh was beyond the last defender when Azmoun passed the ball across the box. The striker could have taken the shot himself, but instead fed Gholizadeh who was clearly in an offside position.
NO GOAL	16'	No goal! After a VAR review, a goal for Iran is ruled out.
COMMENTARY	12'	SAVE! Moore has the first shot on target of the game. From the right, Roberts' inswinging cross from the right is met by Moore who pokes his effort towards the goal. Getting a touch on it, his shot goes straight at Hosseini, with the goalkeeper pushing the ball away.

Their most recent such game was a 6-0 win against China in March 2018.	3	Iran have never beaten a European opponent at the World Cup in nine previous attempts (D2 L7), conceding 20 goals across those games, with six coming on MD1 in their 6-2 defeat to England.	4	Four of Wales' six games at the World Cup have been drawn (67%), with no side having a higher ratio of their games finishing level in the competition's history.	5	Iran lost 6-2 against England on MD1, the fourth time in their six participations they have lost their opening game at the World Cup. They’ve only lost their first two games at one previous World Cup, doing so in 2006.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	As for Iran, Queiroz makes five alterations to the team that lost 6-2 against England. Coming off in the previous match, goalkeeper Beyranvand is replaced by Hosseini. In the defence, the right-back is also different, with Rezaeian coming in for Moharrami. In front of him on the right wing, Gholizadeh is preferred ahead of Jahanbakhsh, with Ezatolahi swapping with Karimi in the midfield. Finally, with Iran playing an extra striker instead of a centre-back, Azmoun starts instead of Cheshmi.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Wales make just one change to the team that drew with the USA last time out. It comes in the attack, with Bournemouth striker Moore replacing James who drops to the bench. Allen is also named as a substitute after coming back from injury.
