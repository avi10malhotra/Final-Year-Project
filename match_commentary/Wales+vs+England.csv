INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	England have finished top of their World Cup group for the first time since 2006, when they were eventually eliminated by Portugal at the quarter-final stage.	2	Wales are winless in their last eight games in all competitions (D2 L6), losing more games in this run than they did in their first 23 under Rob Page (W10 D8 L5).	3	Marcus Rashford's second goal was England's 100th scored at the World Cup, while it made him just the second Manchester United player to score 3+ goals for the Three Lions at a major tournament after Bobby Charlton (1966 World Cup).
COMMENTARY	Post Match	Putting on a comprehensive performance today, England stroll through to the knockout stages; seeing off the challenge of neighbours Wales, who exit the finals with a muted display. A brilliant brace from Rashford, plus Foden's direct approach - and goal - helped the Three Lions overcome limited opponents, who are now surely at the end of their golden era. Southgate's side roll on to the last 16 as Group B winners; Wales finish fourth.
COMMENTARY	90+1'	MISS! In the first minute of four added on for stoppages at the end of the match, a corner from Foden is nodded down by Maguire for Stones on the brink of the six-yard box. However, he leans back and somehow blazes his shot over the bar!
SUBSTITUTION	81'	IN	Rubin Colwill	Wales · Midfielder #25	OUT	Joe Allen	Wales · Midfielder #7	Injury ends Allen's unsuccessful comeback to the Wales starting XI; Colwill comes on to replace him.
COMMENTARY	80'	The action is brought to a halt as Allen is crouched near the centre circle and appears to have picked up an injury.
COMMENTARY	77'	SUPER STOP! Again, Ward rescues Wales, as he gets a firm hand to repel Bellingham's low effort from inside the box. Then, Foden fails to get a toe on the rebound, which just slips behind him.
SUBSTITUTION	77'	IN	Harry Wilson	Wales · Midfielder #8	OUT	Daniel James	Wales · Midfielder #20	Page responds with another substitution, as James is replaced by his clubmate Wilson for the closing stages.
SUBSTITUTION	76'	IN	Jack Grealish	England · Midfielder #7	OUT	Marcus Rashford	England · Striker #11	Receiving rapturous applause from the England fans - and a hug from his manager - two-goal hero Rashford makes way for Grealish.
COMMENTARY	72'	SAVE! Ward denies Rashford his hat-trick; making a save with his boot at his near post, after Wilson smartly slipped through the England striker in the area.
INSIGHTS	68'	England's nine goals in the 2022 World Cup group stage is their most ever in a single group at any edition of a major tournament.
GOOOAAALLL!!!	68'	Wales	0	-	3	England	Marcus Rashford	England · Striker #11	Asst: K. Phillips	ENGLAND STRIKE AGAIN! The Three Lions have their 100th World Cup finals goal! Phillips flips a ball over the top to pick out Rashford on the right, and the Manchester United man steps inside three limp challenges to power a low shot at Ward, who can only deflect the ball into the net! It's 3-0 to England, and they can make plans for the last 16!
SUBSTITUTION	65'	IN	Kieran Trippier	England · Defender #12	OUT	Luke Shaw	England · Defender #3	England make a further change, as Shaw is replaced by Trippier at left-back.
YELLOW CARD	61'	Aaron Ramsey	Wales · Midfielder #10	A gratuitous hack on Henderson in midfield brings Ramsey a deserved yellow card.
SUBSTITUTION	59'	IN	Joe Morrell	Wales · Midfielder #16	OUT	Ben Davies	Wales · Defender #4	Morrell is introduced for Davies, with Wales chasing the game.
SUBSTITUTION	58'	IN	Kalvin Phillips	England · Midfielder #14	OUT	Declan Rice	England · Midfielder #4	Rice is also replaced, and - like Walker - another injury doubt coming into the finals, Phillips, is offered a run-out.
SUBSTITUTION	58'	IN	Callum Wilson	England · Striker #24	OUT	Harry Kane	England · Striker #9	Wilson comes on for England captain Kane up front.
SUBSTITUTION	57'	IN	Trent Alexander-Arnold	England · Defender #18	OUT	Kyle Walker	England · Defender #2	Southgate opts for a triple change, after seeing his side take total control since the break. First, Walker makes way for Alexander-Arnold at right-back.
COMMENTARY	56'	SAVE! Adjusting his feet quickly, Pickford reacts to a heavy deflection off Maguire's head; punching away Moore's powerful shot taken from just outside the area!
INSIGHTS	51'	Marcus Rashford has scored England's 100th World Cup goal, making them the seventh nation to reach that total. Gary Lineker has scored 10% of those goals (10/100).
INSIGHTS	51'	Harry Kane is the first English player to assist three goals at a single World Cup since David Beckham in 2002 (also three).
GOOOAAALLL!!!	51'	Wales	0	-	2	England	Phil Foden	England · Striker #20	Asst: H. Kane	FODEN STRIKES! Faced by sluggish defending from an experienced Wales defence, Kane pulls away on the right side of the area and crosses low across the six-yard box for Foden, who arrives at the back post. Without breaking stride, the latter guides the ball into an unguarded net; putting England two goals to the good!!
INSIGHTS	50'	There were just 98 seconds between England's first and second goals.
INSIGHTS	50'	Marcus Rashford has scored his first direct free-kick goal for England, in his 49th cap. It is also the first direct free-kick to be scored at the 2022 World Cup.
GOOOAAALLL!!!	50'	Wales	0	-	1	England	Marcus Rashford	England · Striker #11	ENGLAND LEAD! The Three Lions take the lead! From a 20-yard free-kick, situated on the left side of the area, Rashford sidefoots a dipping shot powerfully past Ward and into the top-right corner! Wales 0-1 England!!
SUBSTITUTION	46'	IN	Brennan Johnson	Wales · Striker #9	OUT	Gareth Bale	Wales · Midfielder #11	Wales captain Bale has succumbed to injury, so Johnson will be his replacement for the second half.
INSIGHTS	Half-time	England have only conceded four first half goals in their last 31 matches in all competitions, while Wales have scored just two first half goals in their last 10 internationals.
COMMENTARY	Half-time	Met by an understandably unambitious Wales side, England have controlled proceedings so far in Al Rayyan, without often threatening to break the deadlock. The Dragons have prioritised a steadfast defence today - though they conceded one good chance from which Ward kept out Rashford - and are still very much in the game. In the other Group B fixture, USA lead Iran, so if the score stays the same there Wales will need to do the unthinkable and score four - and that remains the longest of long shots.
COMMENTARY	38'	OVER! An incisive move from England's midfield sees Bellingham and Henderson exchange a couple of flicked passes just outside the box, before the former guides the ball to Foden. From around 20 yards out, the Manchester City man slams the ball comfortably over the crossbar. It was a lovely move, though!
SUBSTITUTION	36'	IN	Connor Roberts	Wales · Defender #14	OUT	Neco Williams	Wales · Defender #3	Due to a suspected concussion, Williams is replaced at right-back by Roberts.
COMMENTARY	34'	Troublingly, Williams drops back down to the turf, and further treatment is required. The game is paused once again, as the Nottingham Forest full-back debates with the medics whether he can continue.
YELLOW CARD	29'	Daniel James	Wales · Midfielder #20	A crunching tackle on Stones in midfield sees James bring down the England defender and become the first player booked for either side today.
INSIGHTS	27'	Wales are yet to have a shot or a touch in England's box in this match - the only side to have neither a shot nor a touch in their opponent's box in the first half of a World Cup match in 2022 where Ghana v Portugal.
COMMENTARY	23'	Williams lies stricken after a powerful strike from Rashford on the left side of the area thuds into his forehead. That was travelling at some speed, so the full-back requires an assessment from the Welsh medical staff. The action comes to a temporary halt.
COMMENTARY	10'	SAVE! Alert goalkeeping from Ward prevents Rashford giving England the lead! The deputy keeper dives down to block the striker's low effort on the edge of the area, following a smart throughball from Kane. Wales escape!
INSIGHTS	0'	Jude Bellingham tonight becomes the second-youngest player (19 years, 153 days) to earn 20 caps for England, behind only Wayne Rooney (19 years, 24 days).
INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	England have won each of their last six games against Wales, scoring 11 goals in that run and conceding only one, a Gareth Bale free-kick at EURO 2016. Wales’ last victory dates back to May 1984, courtesy of a Mark Hughes goal (1-0).	2	This is England’s first ever FIFA World Cup match against a fellow British side. The Three Lions are unbeaten in all three games against other British teams at the UEFA European Championship (W1 D1 vs Scotland, W1 vs Wales).	3	England have lost their third and final group stage game in just two of their 14 participations at the FIFA World Cup (W7 D5), doing so against Spain in 1950 and Belgium in 2018.	4	Wales (D2 L5) are on a run of seven games without a victory in all competitions for the first time since May 2003 – November 2003 (D2 L5), last enduring a longer winless streak in between March 2000 and September 2001 (12).	5	England drew 0-0 with USA in their last World Cup match, taking their tally of goalless draws at the World Cup to 12, more than any other nation in World Cup history.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Following an unchanged lineup for their first two matches at the finals, England make four changes for today's decisive encounter. Walker completes his return from injury to join Foden, Rashford and Henderson in Southgate's reshuffled XI. As a result, Mount, Sterling, Saka and Trippier are all relegated to the bench.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Following their loss to Iran last week, Wales make three changes to their starting XI, bringing in James, Allen and reserve goalkeeper Ward. The latter replaces Wayne Hennessey, who must serve a suspension following his dismissal on Friday. Wilson and Roberts are the other men to make way, as Page potentially switches to a back four.
