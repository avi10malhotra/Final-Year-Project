INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	The third place play-off at the World Cup has been won by a European team in each of the last 11 editions, with Brazil in 1978 being the last non-European side to win this match (2-1 v Italy).	2	Croatia have only lost two of their 14 total matches across the last two World Cup tournaments (W6 D6): versus France in the 2018 final (2-4) and Argentina in this year’s semi-final (0-3).	3	Morocco’s two defeats at the 2022 World Cup came in the matches where they had their two highest possession figures of the tournament (61% v France and 49% v Croatia). Prior to these two matches, Morocco had averaged just 31% possession and gone unbeaten in five games (W3 D2).
COMMENTARY	Post Match	Croatia finish third in the World Cup after a 2-1 win over Morocco! It took Croatia just seven minutes to break the deadlock as Gvardiol scored a brilliant diving header, but they were pegged back less than two minutes later when Dari nodded in from close range. Orsic restored their lead not long before half-time with a lovely effort that curled in off the far post. Morocco had two big chances in the second half to try and take it to extra time, but Livakovic made himself big to deny En-Nesyri before the forward thumped a header over in the final seconds.
COMMENTARY	90+6'	WHAT A CHANCE! Attiat-Allah whips in a brilliant cross from the left and En-Nesyri rises above Perisic in the middle to thump a header on goal. There's not enough dip on it though, and it lands on the roof of the net.
SUBSTITUTION	90+5'	IN	Kristijan Jakić	Croatia · Midfielder #26	OUT	Mislav Oršić	Croatia · Midfielder #18	One last change from Croatia as they look to run the clock down. Orsic, who scored the match-winner as it stands, goes off to be replaced by Jakic.

COMMENTARY	75'	WHAT A SAVE! The game has truly opened up in the last few minutes and Gvardiol's flicked clearance falls to En-Nesyri at the far post. He lets the ball bounce before hitting the half-volley, but Livakovic spreads himself to smother it.
COMMENTARY	74'	NO PENALTY! Gvardiol makes a brilliant run through the middle and he's one-on-one with the goalkeeper. He's setting himself for a shot when Amrabat kicks his back foot and brings him down, but the referee waves play on, and VAR agrees.

COMMENTARY	Half-time	Croatia take a 2-1 lead over Morocco into half-time in the third-place play-off. This game couldn't be more different to the cagey affair played out in their first group game, with Gvardiol breaking the deadlock with a diving header just seven minutes in.

Croatia were the more dominant side and restored their lead just before the break, with Orsic curling one in off the inside of the post.

Majer's heavy touch takes away his chance for a shot, but Croatia keep hold of the ball as Livaja knocks it out to Orsic. On the left of the box, he hits it first time, curling his shot just over Bounou's outstretched hand and in off the inside of the far post. 2-1 Croatia!
COMMENTARY	37'	CLOSE! Instead of taking this corner short, Ziyech whips in another dangerous cross. Boufal rises highest to glance it on at the near post, but nobody is waiting at the back for a tap-in.

Croatia's goalscorer, Gvardiol, gives away the free-kick and it's not a great delivery from Ziyech, but it loops off Majer in the wall and onto the edge of the six-yard box. Dari is alert and he heads it past Livakovic from close range. 1-1!
