INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	Despite their defeat in this game, Poland qualified from the group stage of a World Cup tournament for the first time since 1986. They had failed to do so in each of their previous three appearances at the tournament prior to this year (2002, 2006 and 2018).	2	Argentina have qualified from the group stage at the World Cup for the fifth consecutive tournament (2006, 2010, 2014, 2018 and 2022), while they have now progressed from the first round group stage for the 13th time in their last 14 World Cup appearances.	3	Poland have lost each of their last four World Cup matches against South American sides by an aggregate score of 0-11, with all four of those defeats coming against different teams (Brazil in 1986, Ecuador in 2006, Colombia in 2018 and Argentina in 2022).
COMMENTARY	Post Match	It's all over at Stadium 974, and Argentina are through to the last 16! The South Americans have thoroughly dismantled Poland to do it. Mac Allister and Alvarez got the goals, but they should have had more after Messi had a penalty saved in the first half. Poland will be mightily relieved they didn't.
COMMENTARY	90+2'	After a long spell of possession, Argentina get bored and decide to attack again. Poland manage to force them back, until Tagliafico is suddenly through on goal! The substitute tries to chip the onrushing Szczesny, who gets a hand to the ball but not enough of one, and it's somehow cleared off the line! Goodness!
COMMENTARY	86'	The torture's not over for Poland fans yet! Lautaro Martinez somehow drags the ball wide with only Szczesny to beat.

COMMENTARY	Half-time	A breathless first half comes to an end. Argentina have been dominant but haven't been able to break the deadlock yet, not helped by Messi's poor penalty which Szczesny easily saved. Poland's goalkeeper has been a busy man. His team-mates have created very little going forward, but they still top Group C for now. More to come!
INSIGHTS	40'	Excluding penalty shootouts, Wojciech Szczesny has become just the third goalkeeper since 1966 to save two penalties at a single World Cup tournament, after Brad Friedel (2002 for USA) and Jan Tomaszewski (1974 for Poland).

MISSED PENALTY	39'	Lionel Messi	Argentina · Striker #10
COMMENTARY	38'	PENALTY FOR ARGENTINA! On second viewing, it looks like Szczesny missed the ball, which went out off Messi's chest after he'd been struck. It's a debatable decision, but Argentina will take it!
PENALTY	38'	Penalty to Argentina! After a VAR review, a penalty is awarded.
COMMENTARY	37'	Hang on! The referee has been asked to go over to the pitchside monitor to look at that incident between Szczesny and Messi again. Szczesny's outstretched glove does make contact with Messi's head but it looks fairly innocuous...
COMMENTARY	36'	Argentina are getting closer! Szczesny pushes Alvarez's left-footed shot away. The Poland goalkeeper gets straight back to his feet to waft away a cross, catching Messi in the process.
INSIGHTS	35'	Argentina had more attempts in the opening 28 minutes of this match against Poland (6) than they had in the entire game last time out against Mexico (5).
COMMENTARY	33'	Di Maria earns Argentina a corner. The Juventus winger's ball in looks like dropping in at the far post, so Szczesny tips it aside for another corner.
