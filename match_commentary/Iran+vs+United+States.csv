INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	USA have now reached the knockout stages of the World Cup in three consecutive appearances at the competition, doing so in 2010 and 2014 previously having been eliminated at this stage in 2006.  	2	Iran have now failed to get past the opening group phase at each of their six World Cup appearances (18 games); only Scotland (23) have played more games at the tournament with all of them coming in the opening group phase.	3	USA have now equaled their longest unbeaten run at the World Cup (W1 D2), having also gone three without defeat in the group stages in 2010 (W1 D2). Indeed, this was their first win at the tournament since a 2-1 victory over Ghana in their opening group game of 2014.
COMMENTARY	Post Match	Iran threw everything they had at the USA, but the Americans overall had more quality and deserved the win. They particularily dominated in the first half, and were able to find their sole goal in the 38th minute through Pulisic. Iran looked a much better side in the second half, with Rezaeian especially showing a lot of quality on the right-hand side, but they ultimately could not get a chance past Turner.
INSIGHTS	90+10'	USA have failed to have a shot on target in the second half. In fact, only Australia (0) have managed fewer in the second half at the 2022 World Cup than USA (1).
INSIGHTS	90+10'	Iran have made 252 successful passes in this match - more than they managed in their meetings with Wales (197) and England (142).

COMMENTARY	Half-time	The first half was all USA, with the Americans much more aggressive and progressive on the ball. Iran were unable to get out of their own half as the United States created several chances. They were eventually awarded for their efforts after Pulisic's close-range strike. Weah thought he had doubled the lead just on the brink of half-time, but he was marginally offside.
SUBSTITUTION	45+3'	IN	Ali Karimi	Iran · Midfielder #18	OUT	Milad Mohammadi	Iran · Defender #5	Mohammadi is down injured, and it's very clear that he can't continue. Karimi comes on in his place.
COMMENTARY	45+1'	A big chance for the USA to double their lead! Adams with some great feet in the middle of the pitch gets the ball to Sargent. He lays it off to Weah for a one-two but Hosseini intercepts.
YELLOW CARD	43'	Tyler Adams	USA · Midfielder #4	Adams gets booked for stopping an Iranian counter.
INSIGHTS	40'	Christian Pulisic (1 goal, 1 assist) is the first player to be involved in two consecutive goals for USA at the World Cup since 2010 (two goals from Landon Donovan against Algeria and Ghana).

GOOOAAALLL!!!	38'	Iran	0	-	1	USA	Christian Pulisic	USA · Striker #10	Asst: S. Dest	GOOOOAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLL!!!!! You can't say it hasn't been coming. The USA have been all over Iran, and they have finally got the ball in the back of the net. McKennie with a good ball to Dest, who heads it into the path of America's star man Pulisic to score. Iran 0-1 United States!
COMMENTARY	28'	HUGE CHANCE FOR THE USA! The ball ricochets straight into the path of Weah, who is alone in the box. The American rushes his header, however, and it's straight into the hands of Beiranvand.
INSIGHTS	1'	USA have made 80 passes that end in the final third, already more than they managed in the first half against Wales (76) and England (36).

INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	This is the first meeting between Iran and USA in any competition since January 2000, with the sides playing out a 1-1 draw in a friendly match in California.	2	Iran beat USA 2-1 in the only previous meeting between the sides at the FIFA World Cup, with that victory eliminating the United States from the 1998 edition in France.	3	USA have lost their third group stage match on seven of their eight participations with this format in the FIFA World Cup, with the exception being a 1-0 win over Algeria in 2010.	4	Following their 2-0 win over Wales on MD2, Iran are looking to win two matches in a single World Cup tournament for the first time.

They’ve never drawn three in a row at the World Cup.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Gregg Berhalter does not have any injury concerns ahead of this clash. The USMNT manager has opted to start Sargent ahead of Haji again, after the latter was dropped for the match against England. The frontline will hope that their quality in front of goal improves, having only scored the one goal against Wales.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Alireza Jahanbakhsh will be forced to watch his team from afar as he was booked for a second time in the tournament against Wales after a high-footed challenge on Chris Mepham. Azmoun was a doubt for Carlos Queiroz's side due to an injury issue, but he starts up top for Iran regardless.
