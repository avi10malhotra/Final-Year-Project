INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	Poland are unbeaten in their opening two games of a World Cup tournament for the first time since 1986 (also W1 D1). In the process, they have equalled their longest run of consecutive clean sheets at the World Cup, keeping three in a row for the first time since 1978. 	2	Saudi Arabia have lost each of their last nine World Cup matches against European teams dating back to 1994, while failing to score a single goal across the last eight.	3	Saudi Arabia have only kept one clean sheet in their 18 matches at the World Cup – indeed, among teams with at least 10 games played, they have the lowest clean sheet ratio in the tournament’s history (6%).
COMMENTARY	Post Match	Poland pick up three points to put themselves in pole position to progress to the Round of 16 ahead of the final game of the group phase. Saudi Arabia played well but goals from Zielinski and Lewandowski made the difference, ultimately, as did Al Dawsari's failure to convert his penalty. A competent performance from them.

COMMENTARY	Half-time	It's been a thrilling first half. Poland are in the lead thanks to Zielinski's goal but, in truth, Saudi Arabia have been much the better side.
