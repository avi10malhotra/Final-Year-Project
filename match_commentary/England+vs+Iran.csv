COMMENTARY	Post Match	England open their World Cup campaign with a 6-2 win over Iran. The Three Lions were out of sight at half-time, taking a 3-0 lead into the break; Bellingham glanced in his first England goal before Saka and Sterling added to the tally. Saka got his second just after the hour mark before Taremi pulled one back when he fired one in off the underside of the bar. Rashford and Grealish both came off the bench to wrap it up, with the former scoring just 49 seconds after his introduction. A late penalty from Taremi after a foul by Stones finished off the game.
GOOOAAALLL!!!	90+13'	England	6	-	2	Iran	Mehdi Taremi	Iran · Striker #9	Penalty Goal	TAREMI SCORES! The referee's whistle went, but Taremi was in no hurry to take the penalty as he stared Pickford down. He takes a couple of stuttering steps before striding to the ball and coolly slotting it into the bottom-right corner, sending the keeper the wrong way. 6-2!
COMMENTARY	90+12'	PENALTY TO IRAN! The referee has been asked to go over to the monitor and have a look at a possible foul on Taremi. Stones has hold of his shirt, with the forward tumbling over, and after looking at the replays, the referee points to the spot!
PENALTY	90+10'	Penalty to Iran! After a VAR review, a penalty is awarded.
COMMENTARY	90+8'	WHAT A SAVE! It's a lovely throughball from Kanani and Rice stretches but can't stop it from reaching Azmoun. He's one-on-one with Pickford, and the keeper gets a finger to the ball to help the powerful strike onto the bar.
GOOOAAALLL!!!	90'	England	6	-	1	Iran	Jack Grealish	England · Midfielder #7	Asst: C. Wilson	GREALISH SCORES! Bellingham slides a lovely throughball down the right and Wilson has space to run into.

COMMENTARY	Half-time	England are cruising at the break, as they lead Iran 3-0. It took a while for the game to get going, especially after a long injury for Beiranvand which forced the keeper off. England found their rhythm though, and Maguire thumped the crossbar with a header before Bellingham glanced them ahead with a lovely finish. Saka then volleyed a second into the top corner, and Sterling added a third minutes later after a quick England break.
COMMENTARY	45+11'	CHANCE! It's a poor backpass from Shaw and it's too high for Rice, which allows Noorollahi to break forward on the counter. He switches it out to Mohammadi on the left who swings in a good cross to the far post, but Jahanbakhsh fires it high over the bar.
GOOOAAALLL!!!	45+1'	England	3	-	0	Iran	Raheem Sterling	England · Midfielder #10	Asst: H. Kane	STERLING SCORES!

It flies through the crowd and into the top corner. 2-0 England!
GOOOAAALLL!!!	35'	England	1	-	0	Iran	Jude Bellingham	England · Midfielder #22	Asst: L. Shaw	BELLINGHAM SCORES! England do manage to work some space down the left and Shaw loops a cross into the box.

COMMENTARY	14'	Beiranvand has finished being patched up, and they're now changing his shirt so he can carry on playing. He looked a bit shaky when he got back to his feet, but at least for now, the first-choice keeper is staying on.
COMMENTARY	12'	Beiranvand is still down receiving treatment, and Hossein Hosseini is now warming up on the sidelines. It's not looking good for the keeper though, and it seems like that change will have to be made.
COMMENTARY	10'	It was a clash of heads between Beiranvand and Hosseini, and the defender is quickly back to his feet after treatment. The keeper is bleeding so he's still down, and it doesn't look too good for him.
COMMENTARY	8'	CHANCE! Trippier takes a quick free-kick, sliding it down the right for Kane and he clips a good cross into the six-yard box. Beiranvard gets fingertips to it before crashing into Hosseini, and Maguire fires it into the side netting.

COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Carlos Quieroz makes eight changes from Iran's last friendly against Nicaragua, with only Beiranvand, Pouraliganji and Cheshmi retaining their places. Taremi, who was involved in six goals during qualifying, leads the line. Azmoun is fit enough for the bench after a calf tear.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Southgate makes four changes to the side that started England's last game against Germany. Pickford starts in goal, with Trippier, Saka and Mount also coming into the team. Foden, Pope and Dier start on the bench, as does Walker, though it may be too soon for him as he continues to recover from a groin injury.
