COMMENTARY	Post Match	Heartbreak for Mexico as they are out of the World Cup despite a 2-1 win over Saudi Arabia. Mexico were on top from the first whistle and finally got their breakthrough just two minutes into the second half when Martin poked in from close range. Chavez then scored a truly outstanding long-range free-kick to make it 2-0. They needed a third to leapfrog Poland into second place, and Lozano and Antuna both had goals disallowed for tight offsides before Al Dawsari ended their hopes with a late consolation for Saudi Arabia.

COMMENTARY	Half-time	It's goalless at the break between Saudi Arabia and Mexico. That isn't to say there haven't been chances though, with Mexico in particular creating some good openings.

INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	Mexico have never lost against Saudi Arabia in all competitions (W4 D1), with all five meetings between the sides coming between 1995 and 1999.	2	This is Saudi Arabia’s 19th game at the FIFA World Cup, with all 19 coming against different opponents. It’s the most any nation has played in the competition without ever playing the same side more than once.	3	Saudi Arabia are looking to qualify for the knockout stages of the World Cup for only a second time, and first since their first ever participation in 1994, when they were eventually eliminated from the second round by Sweden.	4	Mexico are winless in their last four World Cup games (D1 L3), while only once in their history have they been on a longer such run at the tournament, failing to win their first 13 games between 1930 and 1962 (D1 L12).  	5	Saudi Arabia have only kept one clean sheet in their 18 matches at the World Cup, conceding 42 goals at the finals (2.3 per game). Indeed, among teams with at least 10 games played, they have the lowest clean sheet ratio in the tournament’s history (6%).
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Gerardo Martino makes four changes to the side that lost to Argentina on Saturday and switches to a back four. Sanchez, Edson Alvarez, Peneda and Martin come in. Kevin Alvarez, Araujo, Herrera and Guardado, who went off in that game with a muscle problem, all drop to the bench.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Herve Renard makes just three changes from the loss to Poland last time out, bringing in Tambakti, Al Ghannam and Al Hassan. Al Naji starts on the bench, Abdulelah Al Malki is suspended, and Mohammed Al Burayk is out after going off injured in that game. Sharahili is fit enough to be a substitute after recovering from his own injury problem.
