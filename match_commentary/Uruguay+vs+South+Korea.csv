INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	Eight different sides have now drawn their opening game of the 2022 World Cup 0-0 (Denmark, Tunisia, Mexico, Poland, Morocco, Croatia, Uruguay, Korea Republic), which is already the most ever in a single edition of the tournament.	2	Uruguay have only lost their opening game of a World Cup tournament in three of their 14 appearances (W6 D5), while three of the last six have been goalless draws (1990, 2010 and 2022).	3	Korea Republic have kept consecutive clean sheets at the World Cup for the first time, having won 2-0 against Germany in their previous match in 2018. They are also unbeaten in consecutive games in the tournament for the first time since 2006 (2-1 v Togo and 1-1 v France).
COMMENTARY	Post Match	The first half was evenly contested with both sides having good spells throughout. South Korea started and ended the half well with their best chance coming in the 34th minute when Ui-Jo fired over the bar despite being uncontested inside the box. Godin almost scored against the run of play just before the break as his header from a corner crashed against the woodwork, Uruguay's best chance of the half. The second half was quiet for the most part, but it burst into life toward the end. Valverde hit the post with a long-range effort in the 90th minute before Son shot wide at the other end after a mistake from Rochet. Neither side could find a goal as the game finished 0-0.

INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	This is the third FIFA World Cup match between Uruguay and Korea Republic. So far, Uruguay have won both previous encounters: 1-0 in the 1990 group stages and 2-1 in the round of 16 of the 2010 edition, the latter courtesy of a Luis Suarez brace of goals.	2	This is Uruguay’s 14th FIFA World Cup participation, and their fourth in a row since 2010. It will be only the second time that they have participated in four consecutive Would Cups (1962, 1966, 1970, 1974).	3	Uruguay have won six of their last eight FIFA World Cup games (L2). They won four matches at the 2018 edition in Russia (Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Portugal), tying the most wins they have ever had in a single World Cup, after 1930 (Peru, Romania, Yugoslavia, Argentina). 	4	Uruguay have won their opening match at just one of their last seven World Cup participations (D3 L3), though it did come last time out in 2018 against Egypt. Nonetheless, they have still progressed from the group stage in five of those seven editions.	5	This will be Korea Republic’s 11th FIFA World Cup tournament, the most of any Asian nation. Meanwhile, 2022 will be their 10th consecutive appearance at the finals, a run stretching back to 1986; only Brazil, Germany, Argentina and Spain are on longer current runs.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Alonso makes four changes from Uruguay’s most recent fixture as Godin, Gimenez, Vecino, and Pellistri all start. Bento makes nine changes from South Korea’s win over Iceland a fortnight ago as only Seung-Gyu and Woo-Young keep their places in the starting 11.
