INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	Japan have progressed to the knockout rounds in consecutive World Cup tournaments for the first time, while they’ve finished top of their group for the first time since 2002.	2	Spain have lost their final group stage game (excluding second group stage) at the World Cup for the first time since 1982 (1-0 vs N. Ireland), having won eight of their previous nine such games before today (D1).	3	Japan have become the third team in World Cup history to be losing at half time and come back to win two matches in a single edition, after Brazil in 1938 and Germany in 1970.
COMMENTARY	Post Match	All over and both Japan and Spain progress to the Round of 16. Spain took the lead in the first half through Morata only for Japan to mount a dramatic comeback in the second half following goals from Doan and Tanaka. That, coupled with the fact that Germany beat Costa Rica in the group's other game, means that Japan go through as group winners while Spain go through as runners-up.
INSIGHTS	90+7'	Marco Asensio's shot in the 89th minute was Spain's first on target since the 23rd minute.
INSIGHTS	90+7'	There was just 142 seconds between Ritsu Doan's equaliser and Ao Tanaka's goal for Japan.
COMMENTARY	90'	CHANCE! Asensio stings Gonda's palms with a fine strike from distance and then, seconds later, Olmo tests him again. But Japan hold firm.

GOOOAAALLL!!!	51'	Japan	2	-	1	Spain	Ao Tanaka	Japan · Midfielder #17	Asst: K. Mitoma	GOAL! Tanaka scores to fire Japan into the lead. Doan did superbly to square the ball across the face of goal to find Mitoma, who did well to cut the ball back to Tanaka, who managed to bundle the ball over the line and make it 2-1.
GOOOAAALLL!!!	48'	Japan	1	-	1	Spain	Ritsu Doan	Japan · Striker #8	Asst: J. Ito	GOAL! Doan gets Japan back on level terms. The substitute, just on the pitch, seizes the ball at the edge of the box after sloppy defending by Spain before unleashing a fine effort into the top corner of the net, too much power on the shot for Simon to save it.

INSIGHTS	Half-time	Spain are unbeaten in each of the last 16 World Cup games when leading at half time (W14 D2), including wins in each of their last six.
COMMENTARY	Half-time	Spain are a goal to the good at half-time. They've been utterly dominant from the first whistle, pinning Japan back in their own half and not allowing them a second to breathe. Morata was the man to provide the decisive goal, arrowing in a fine header after Azpilicueta's cross from the right side. As things stand, Spain are going through and Japan are going out - Germany are beating Costa Rica 1-0 in the group's other game.
YELLOW CARD	45'	Maya Yoshida	Japan · Defender #22	Yoshida is booked after snapping into Morata.
YELLOW CARD	44'	Shogo Taniguchi	Japan · Defender #3	Taniguchi is issued a yellow card for a poor tackle on Gavi.
YELLOW CARD	39'	Kou Itakura	Japan · Defender #4	Itakura is booked for a late challenge on Pedri.
INSIGHTS	30'	Dani Olmo has been involved in more shot creating actions than any other player for Spain at the World Cup so far (10), taking six shots and creating a further four chances.
COMMENTARY	26'	CHANCE! Azpilicueta drives forward down the right before playing in Morata, who does well to chop the ball back across the face of goal for Olmo to get a shot off. It's ultimately unsuccessful, although Morata had strayed offside in the build-up so it would have been ruled out in any case.
INSIGHTS	14'	Only David Villa (13) has scored more goals at major competitions for Spain (Euros/World Cups) than Álvaro Morata (9).
INSIGHTS	11'	Álvaro Morata is just the second Spaniard to score in each of his first three World Cup appearances after Telmo Zarra in 1950.
GOOOAAALLL!!!	11'	Japan	0	-	1	Spain	Álvaro Morata	Spain · Striker #7	Asst: C. Azpilicueta	GOAL! Morata makes it 1-0 to Spain. The forward arrows a fine header past Gonda after Azpilicueta floats in an inch-perfect cross from the right side.
COMMENTARY	8'	CHANCE! Busquets is caught on the ball at the edge of his own area and, while Japan don't exactly scythe through Spain's defence, they do get a shot off when the ball falls to Ito wide right of the goal. But his effort crashes into the side netting.
INSIGHTS	0'	Yuto Nagatomo is making his 14th World Cup appearance for Japan, only Korea Republic's Myung-Bo Hong (16) has made more appearances at the competition for an Asian nation.
INSIGHTS	0'	Alejandro Balde’s start for Spain means they are the fifth side to have started three different teenagers in a single edition of the World Cup (Pedri and Gavi also) after Bulgaria in 1962, Cameroon in 1994 and 1998 and Nigeria in 2002.
INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	Spain won their only previous meeting with Japan in all competitions, winning a friendly match 1-0 in April 2001.	2	Spain have never lost in five previous FIFA World Cup matches against Asian opposition (W3 D2), though they were eliminated via penalties by Korea Republic in 2002 following one of those draws.	3	Spain have won their final group game in eight of their last nine participations in the FIFA World Cup, with the exception being a 2-2 draw with Morocco last time out in 2018.	4	Japan have lost three of their last four World Cup matches (W1), as many as in their previous nine games at the tournament (W3 D3), while they are looking to avoid failing to score in consecutive World Cup matches for the first time since 1998 (vs Argentina and Croatia).	5	Spain are now unbeaten in their last seven matches at the World Cup (W3 D4) – only once in their history have they had a longer run in the competition without suffering defeat (10 games between 1998 and 2006).
