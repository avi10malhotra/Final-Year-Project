INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	England have had 12 goalless draws at the World Cup, the most of any nation in the history of the World Cup.

They had gone 18 such games without one before today.
COMMENTARY	Post Match	England and USA have played out the fifth goalless draw of this World Cup and counting. Neither team deserved to win this, in truth. The Americans worried the English in the first hour before Southgate's men managed to quieten things down. They couldn't break down their well-organised opponents though, and the game soon petered out.
INSIGHTS	90+5'	England have mustered just six shots in this game - their joint-lowest total in a World Cup match since we have this data (1966), level with six v the Republic of Ireland in 1990.
COMMENTARY	90+3'	Shaw whips the free-kick in from the left. It reaches Kane, who sends a powerful header wide from the centre of the box! That's as close to scoring as England have gotten.
INSIGHTS	87'	No player has had more headed clearances in a 2022 World Cup match so far than England's Harry Maguire today (6 so far).

SUBSTITUTION	78'	IN	Shaquell Moore	USA · Defender #18	OUT	Sergiño Dest	USA · Defender #2	Dest is the next USA player to make way, and he's not happy about it. Moore takes his place at right-back.
SUBSTITUTION	77'	IN	Brenden Aaronson	USA · Midfielder #11	OUT	Weston McKennie	USA · Midfielder #8	The Americans make some substitutions. McKennie's their first departure. Aaronson replaces him.

SUBSTITUTION	69'	IN	Jordan Henderson	England · Midfielder #8	OUT	Jude Bellingham	England · Midfielder #22	Bellingham leaves the pitch too. Henderson comes on to provide experience in midfield for England.
SUBSTITUTION	68'	IN	Jack Grealish	England · Midfielder #7	OUT	Raheem Sterling	England · Midfielder #10	England decide that changes are needed. The quiet Sterling heads off. Grealish replaces him.

COMMENTARY	Half-time	An action-packed first half comes to an end. USA will be happier with how they played in the opening 45 minutes, looking lively and hitting the crossbar through Pulisic. England have been sluggish, but we know they can go up a gear or two. More to come!
COMMENTARY	45'	England create thier best chance of the game yet. Shaw reaches the byline and cuts back for Saka, who can't keep his hit from inside the six-yard box down.

INSIGHTS	33'	John Stones has made 43 passes in the game so far for England, more than any other player in the game, completing all 43. Indeed he has only misplaced one of his 160 so far in the competition.
COMMENTARY	32'	Pulisic hits the crossbar! McKennie escapes the attention of Rice and passes inside to Musah. He moves the ball on to the Chelsea winger, whose strike ricochets against the woodwork! England have been warned.
COMMENTARY	26'	McKennie spurns a great opportunity to open the scoring! The midfielder with multicoloured hair peels off his marker to reach a cross and lashes a half-volley over the crossbar.
