INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	Tunisia have won two of their last four games at the World Cup (D1 L1), beating Panama in 2018 and France in this match. This is one more victory than they managed in their first 14 games in the competition combined (D4 L9).	2	France were beaten in a World Cup match for the first time since the 2014 quarter-final (0-1 v Germany), ending a run of nine games without defeat (W8 D1). They have now gone without a win in their final group match in each of the last four World Cup tournaments (D2 L2), while failing to score in the last three.	3	Tunisia only conceded one goal in their three games at the 2022 World Cup; the joint-fewest by an African team across a full group stage in the tournament, along with Cameroon in 1982 and Morocco in 1986.
COMMENTARY	Post Match	It's all over, and despite Australia's win over Denmark putting paid to their chances of reaching the last 16, Tunisia hold on to record an historic victory over the world champions! The Eagles of Carthage secured their breakthrough, and their first goal of the tournament, thanks to Wahbi Khazri's wonderful strike. France piled on the pressure thereafter, and Antoine Griezmann thought he had scored a late equaliser, but VAR put paid to his efforts. Tunisia secure a victory which does not send them through, but will be long remembered in the annuls of Tunisian football.
INSIGHTS	90+13'	Wahbi Khazri is the first African player in World Cup history to score in three consecutive starts (vs Belgium and Panama in 2018 & today vs France).
NO GOAL	90+11'	No goal! After a VAR review, a goal for France is ruled out.
COMMENTARY	90+10'	NO GOAL!!! VAR replays show Griezmann to be a fair few yards offside from Tchouameni's initial cross, and the goal will not stand, meaning Tunisia are back into the lead!
COMMENTARY	90+8'	BALL IN THE NET!!! France think they've equalised to seal Tunisia's fate!!! The French pressure finally tells as Tchouameni crosses in from the edge of the box. It's not cleared properly by Tunisia, and Griezmann smashes the loose ball into the far corner! The goal is initially given, but the referee's hearing something in his ear here...
COMMENTARY	90+3'	BLOCKED!!! Mbappe is felled right on the edge of the area by Chaalali, but France's star man can only blast his free-kick into a strong Tunisian wall!
COMMENTARY	90'	WIDE!!! Great play from France results in Griezmann squaring for Kolo Muani. He takes a touch before shooting, with his well-hit shot taking a slight nick which sees it roll inches wide of the post!
COMMENTARY	89'	SAVED!!! Mbappe picks up the ball on the left, and shows typically superb skill, speed and dexterity to keep it in play and beat two defenders. He smashes a shot from a tight angle, which is well stopped and parried away by Dahmen!
SUBSTITUTION	83'	IN	Ali Al-Abdi	Tunisia · Defender #24	OUT	Anis Ben Slimane	Tunisia · Midfielder #25	Ben Slimane is the third of Tunisia's front three to come off, and Ali Abdi will play the rest of this game.
COMMENTARY	82'	SAVED!!! Another fizzing Griezmann corner results in pinball in the Tunisia box, and Kolo Muani back-heels it into the centre of the area. It's laid off for Dembele on the edge, who smashes a decent effort straight into the gloves of Dahmen!
COMMENTARY	80'	OVER!! Griezmann's corner is met by Disasi in the centre of the box, who heads just over the bar from eight yards out!
COMMENTARY	79'	SAVED!!! Dembele fizzes in a cross from the right which swerves through the air before dipping wildly. It drops to the right of Dahmen, who sees the ball late and pushes it away from danger!
SUBSTITUTION	79'	IN	Ousmane Dembélé	France · Striker #11	OUT	Mattéo Guendouzi	France · Striker #6	Another French change sees Guendouzi withdrawn, with another attacking option, in the shape of Ousmane Dembele, replacing him.
SUBSTITUTION	74'	IN	Ghaylène Chaalali	Tunisia · Midfielder #18	OUT	Mohamed Ali Ben Romdhane	Tunisia · Midfielder #15	Ben Romdhane has been another of the brightest stars for Tunisia in this game, and comes off now for Ghaylene Chaalali to see out the remainder of it.
INSIGHTS	62+11'	Wahbi Khazri has been involved in each of Tunisia's last five goals at the World Cup (3 goals, 2 assists).
SUBSTITUTION	73'	IN	Antoine Griezmann	France · Striker #7	OUT	Youssouf Fofana	France · Midfielder #13	France go for the jugular with another attacking change, as Fofana comes off for Antoine Griezmann.
INSIGHTS	61+10'	Ibrahima Konaté has made nine tackles today - the only France player with more in a World Cup game since 1966 is Maxime Bossis vs Italy in 1978 (13).
SUBSTITUTION	63'	IN	Kylian Mbappé	France · Striker #10	OUT	Kingsley Coman	France · Striker #20	Kylian Mbappe is the joint-top scorer at this World Cup with three goals so far, and he completes France's triple change as he comes on for Coman.
SUBSTITUTION	63'	IN	Adrien Rabiot	France · Midfielder #14	OUT	Jordan Veretout	France · Midfielder #15	Veretout has also been somewhat of a passenger so far, and he's replaced in midfield by Adrien Rabiot.
SUBSTITUTION	63'	IN	William Saliba	France · Defender #17	OUT	Raphaël Varane	France · Defender #4	Varane comes off for France, who have been all over the place at the back, and Arsenal centre-back William Saliba is on for his first minutes of the tournament.
SUBSTITUTION	60'	IN	Issam Jebali	Tunisia · Striker #9	OUT	Wahbi Khazri	Tunisia · Striker #10	That's some send off for Khazri, as the Tunisia captain comes off for Issam Jebali after opening the scoring against the world champions!
GOOOAAALLL!!!	58'	Tunisia	1	-	0	France	Wahbi Khazri	Tunisia · Striker #10	Asst: A. Laïdouni	GOOOOOOAAAAALLLL!!!!! Tunisia have their goal!!! It's their first strike of this World Cup finals, and what a way, and what a time, to get it!!! Tunisia win the ball again and Laidouni plays it forward to Khazri. He turns and glides towards goal, stepping beyond two defenders before slotting the ball into the far corner of Mandanda's goal! 1-0 to Tunisia, and as it stands, that goal will be enough to send them into the last 16!
COMMENTARY	52'	OVER!!!! Laidouni chases a throughball into the box, but Disasi intercepts. Laidouni follows in to dispossess the France defender in his own box, before firing a decent effort past Mandanda and over the bar from a tight angle!
INSIGHTS	Half-time	France with just two shots in the first half against Tunisia, their fewest in the first half of a group stage match at a World Cup since 1966.
COMMENTARY	Half-time	The first half ends, with the world champions looking a shadow of their usual selves! Much-changed France have looked disjointed at both ends of the pitch, while Tunisia are playing exactly like a side who are desperate to win this game at all costs. They've had the ball in the net once, but Ghandri's early volley was ruled out for offside. Since then though, the Eagles of Carthage have peppered the France box with several chances, but the net has eluded them so far and as things stand in Group D, Tunisia are still bottom, and heading home.
COMMENTARY	45+2'	HALF-TIME: TUNISIA 0-0 FRANCE.
COMMENTARY	45+2'	BLOCKED!!! France profit from a loose Tunisia pass and Fofana drives forward with the ball. He lets fly from the edge of the box, but Meriah gets in the way!
COMMENTARY	42'	CHANCE!!! Tunisia fly forward as Khazri ghosts in behind Camavinga in the box. He drills the ball across the face of goal from the byline, but Disasi flicks it away as the offside flag goes up!
COMMENTARY	35'	SAVED!! Another Tunisian cross is whipped into the French box, and Varane heads it away. It falls to Khazri 35 yards from goal, who smashes a half-volley which the unsighted Mandanda can only parry into the crowd of defenders!
COMMENTARY	34'	WIDE!!! Maaloul fires a cross towards the back post which centre-back Ghandri is steaming onto, but Camavinga knocks it behind with a good piece of defending!
COMMENTARY	30'	SAVED!!! Laidouni's attempted cross is blocked, but he's in the box again to receive the resultant throw-in. He curls another cross, on to the head of Ben Slimane, whose glancing effort is held by Mandanda!
YELLOW CARD	28'	Wajdi Kechrida	Tunisia · Midfielder #21	Kechrida slides in on Camavinga as the France man cuts inside, and the mistimed challenge warrants a yellow card for the Tunisian left-back.
COMMENTARY	25'	WIDE!!! Forward come France on the break as Fofana marches up the field. He finds Coman in the box, but the winger's first touch is poor, and the second sees him smash an attempt wide of the target!
COMMENTARY	17'	CHANCE! France lose the ball once again and Tunisia look to make them pay. Ben Slimane outmuscles Varane off the ball and feeds Ben Romdhane, but he can't keep the ball in play and lashes it into the side netting!
COMMENTARY	8'	BALL IN THE NET!!! Tunisia think they've taken the lead but the flag is up!!! Tchouameni concedes a free-kick which is curled into the box by Khazri. Ghandri meets the ball at the front post and hits a beautiful side-footed volley to slam the ball beyond Mandanda and into the net! The Tunisia players wheel away in celebration, but they're stopped by the raised offside flag!
INSIGHTS	1'	This is now the longest wait we've had a for a shot in a 2022 World Cup match (previously longest was 21st minute, Brazil vs Serbia).
INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	France have never lost in four previous meetings with Tunisia (W2 D2), with this their first encounter since a 1-1 draw in May 2010.	2	France have alternated between winning (3) and losing (2) in each of their five FIFA World Cup matches against African nations, beating Nigeria 2-0 in their last such match in 2014.	3	Tunisia remain winless in the 2022 World Cup (D1 L1); should they also fail to win this match, it will mean they haven’t won a game in four of their six World Cup appearances (also 1998, 2002, and 2006). The African side have never progressed from their group at the World Cup.	4	France have won each of their last six World Cup games, their longest ever winning run in the competition. Indeed, only Italy (7 between 1934-1938) and Brazil (11 between 2002-2006) have ever had longer winning runs.	5	Tunisia are yet to score from 27 shots in their two games at the 2022 World Cup. The African side have never gone through an entire World Cup edition without scoring, with this their sixth appearance.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	France go three steps further, having made nine changes ahead of this match. Having already qualified, Didier Deschamps gives some players on the fringes of the squad the chance to impress, with captain Hugo Lloris replaced by Steve Mandanda in goal. Raphael Varane keeps his place and captains the side, while Real Madrid midfielder Eduardo Camavinga slots into a makeshift left-back role, and talisman Kylian Mbappe is replaced in attack by late call-up Randal Kolo Muani.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Tunisia have made six changes from their 1-0 loss to Australia, many of which come in attacking positions for a side still searching for their first goal of the tournament. Captain Wahbi Khazri will lead the line in a false-nine role, looking to bring his teammates into play against a rotated French defence.
