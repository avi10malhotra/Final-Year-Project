INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	Brazil are unbeaten in their opening game in each of the last 20 editions of the World Cup (W17 D3), since losing 3-1 against Spain in 1934.	2	As an independent nation, Serbia have lost eight of their 10 matches at the World Cup, the highest loss percentage of any side to have played at least 10 games (80%).	3	Brazil's Neymar was fouled nine times in this match, at least four more fouls won than any other player at the 2022 World Cup so far.
COMMENTARY	Post Match	After several chances that were not taken in the first 45 minutes, Brazil came out after half-time and continued to put Serbia on the backfoot. The opener came in the 62nd minute, Richarlison taking advantage of the ball Vanja Milinkovic-Savic parried into his path, smashing it into the back of the net. Richarlison also scored Brazil's second, an impressive acrobatic volley in the 73rd minute to secure the win. Serbia were relatively toothless going forward, and were unable to test Brazil's backline.

SUBSTITUTION	83'	IN	Nemanja Maksimović	Serbia · Midfielder #6	OUT	Aleksandar Mitrović	Serbia · Striker #9	Mitrovic comes off for Maksimovic. A quiet game for the striker, but his team rarely could get the ball up the pitch. Not much he could do.

GOOOAAALLL!!!	62'	Brazil	1	-	0	Serbia	Richarlison	Brazil · Striker #9	GOOOOAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLL! Brazil 1-0 Serbia! And the opener comes for Brazil from Richarlison. Neymar does well to evade several Serbian defenders in the box, and the ball is then taken by Vinicius, who takes a powerful shot from the left. It's saved, but the Spurs striker hits the rebound right into the back of the net.
COMMENTARY	60'	Sandro hits the bar! The full-back rips a powerful shot from about 30 yards out, and it slams against the bar!
INSIGHTS	57'	Neymar is now the most fouled player at this World Cup (7 - two more than any other player)

INSIGHTS	55'	Since his first World Cup in 2014, Neymar has had more direct free kick shots without scoring one than any other player (9)
COMMENTARY	55'	Another chance for Brazil! Vinicius from the left flank gets it to Neymar who is right in the middle of the box. He hits it first-time with the toe of his boots, and it drifts wide.
COMMENTARY	54'	Brazil really continuing to push now. Pavlovic comes in with a fantastic last-ditch tackle on Raphinha in the box. He had to time that perfectly, as it could have easily been a penalty!
INSIGHTS	49'	Marquinhos and Lucas Paqueta are the only Brazilian outfield players who have not had a shot for Brazil in this match so far.
YELLOW CARD	49'	Nemanja Gudelj	Serbia · Midfielder #8	Gudelj tackles Neymar from behind as the Brazilian runs into the box, and the referee does not hesitate to book him.

INSIGHTS	45'	Brazil have lost just one of their last 11 World Cup games that were 0-0 at half time (W7 D3).
INSIGHTS	45'	Eight of Brazil's last 10 World Cup goals have come in the second half
COMMENTARY	Half-time	As expected, Brazil certainly had more of the ball and the better chances in the first half, but Serbia did well to defend against the tournament favourites. Raphinha will certainly regret not making the most of the chance he had late in the half, a tame shot after good play between himself and Paqueta.
INSIGHTS	45'	Brazil had four shots in this first half - that's the lowest number they've had in the first half of a WC group stage match since against Ivory Coast in 2010 (also 4)
INSIGHTS	45'	Neymar is the joint-most fouled player in the 2022 World Cup (5, alongside Gavi)
COMMENTARY	35'	Chance for Brazil! Raphinha gets a shot off in the box after a quick one-two with Paqueta, but his shot is weak, and it's an easy save.
COMMENTARY	28'	Big chance for Brazil! Silva with a great through ball into Vinicius, but Vanja Milinkovic-Savic gets low, and swipes the ball away from the winger's feet. Fantastic save!
COMMENTARY	26'	Serbia get a chance to counter! Brazil lose the ball, and Tadic pounces. He crosses it in for Mitrovic, but Alisson jumps over, and catches the ball before it can reach the head of the Serbian striker.
YELLOW CARD	7'	Strahinja Pavlović	Serbia · Defender #2	Pavlovic gets booked early for a foul on Neymar.
INSIGHTS	0'	Neymar's shot at 20:05 is the second latest into a single World Cup game (since 1966) that the first shot has come, after Netherlands v Costa Rica in 2014 (20:59)
INSIGHTS	0'	Thiago Silva (38y 63d) becomes the oldest player with a World Cup appearance for Brazil, overtaking Djalma Santos (37y 138d in 1966).
INSIGHTS	0'	Nemanja Gudelj wins his 50th cap for Serbia
INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	Brazil have won each of their two previous encounters with Serbia, including their group stage fixture at the last FIFA World Cup (2-0, June 2018). The other was a 1-0 win in a friendly back in June 2014.	2	Brazil are the only team to have taken part in every single FIFA World Cup since its original edition in 1930; this will be their 22nd appearance.	3	Brazil are unbeaten in their last 15 World Cup group games, winning 12 (D3), their last defeat in the group phase dating back to 1998 against Norway. In fact, Brazil have topped their group in round one in every single World Cup since 1982, and last failed to progress past the first round in 1966.	4	In addition to winning a record five FIFA World Cups, Brazil have won more games (73) and have the best win rate (67% - 73 wins in 109 games) of any nation in the tournament’s history.	5	Including 2022, Serbia have now qualified for four of the last five FIFA World Cup tournaments, failing only in 2014. However, since the start of this stretch in 2006, they have lost seven of nine World Cup matches (W2), the most defeats by any European nation, with only Australia (8) losing more among all nations.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Many questions were asked about whether Mitrovic would be fit enough to start for Serbia due to his ankle injury, but it seems the medical staff have given the clear, as Dragan Stojkovis names the Fulham striker in his starting XI.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Tite has a fully fit squad at his disposal as Antony, Guimaraes and Telles have all recovered from minor injuries. All three make the bench. Richarlison, who managed to recover from his calf strain injury in time for the tournament, is given the not ahead Jesus up top.
