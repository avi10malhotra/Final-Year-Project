INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	Netherlands have progressed from five of their last six round of 16 matches at the World Cup, including progressing from their last three appearances at this stage (2010, 2014, 2022).	2	Netherlands are unbeaten in their last 11 World Cup games (W8 D3), extending their longest ever unbeaten spell in the tournament.	3	USA have failed to win all 24 World Cup matches in which they conceded the first goal of the game, losing 19 times in the process (D5).
COMMENTARY	Post Match	An impressively clinical performance from the Netherlands sees them through to the last eight of Qatar 2022, as they swat aside the challenge of a high-energy USA team. Soaking up some pressure at times, the Oranje used all of their experience - and that of their celebrated coach - to take advantage of the States' naivety and score three times, with the irrepressible Dumfries involved on each occasion. The first was a fluid footballing moment reminiscent of their famed Total Football, and though they were briefly tested by conceding a second-half goal, Van Gaal's men deservedly take their place in the quarter-finals.
SUBSTITUTION	90+3'	IN	Wout Weghorst	Netherlands · Striker #19	OUT	Cody Gakpo	Netherlands · Striker #8	Van Gaal also offers Weghorst a brief cameo, as Gakpo takes his leave.
SUBSTITUTION	90+3'	IN	Matthijs de Ligt	Netherlands · Defender #3	OUT	Nathan Aké	Netherlands · Defender #5	After a seamless performance, Ake makes way for De Ligt in the Dutch defence.
SUBSTITUTION	90+2'	IN	Jordan Morris	USA · Striker #16	OUT	Antonee Robinson	USA · Defender #5	As time ticks away, Berhalter resorts to replacing full-back Robinson with another striker, Morris.
INSIGHTS	90'	Xavi Simons is just the fourth teenager to appear for Netherlands at the World Cup after Bertus de Harder (1938), Frits van der Veen (1938) & Ryan Babel (2006).
INSIGHTS	88'	Denzel Dumfries (1 goal, 2 assists) is the first Dutch player to be involved in 3+ goals in a single World Cup game since Rob Rensenbrink vs Austria in 1978 (1 goal, 3 assists).
YELLOW CARD	87'	Frenkie de Jong	Netherlands · Midfielder #21	A clear and deliberate trip on Aaronson in midfield earns De Jong a merited booking.
SUBSTITUTION	83'	IN	Xavi Simons	Netherlands · Midfielder #25	OUT	Memphis Depay	Netherlands · Striker #10	Having only recently returned to fitness, Depay cannot last the pace; young Simons comes on to make his debut.
GOOOAAALLL!!!	81'	Netherlands	3	-	1	USA	Denzel Dumfries	Netherlands · Midfielder #22	Asst: D. Blind	DUMFRIES DOES IT AGAIN! Surely putting his nation into the World Cup quarter-finals, Dumfries adds to his pair of assists by steering the Netherlands 3-1 up! Meeting Blind's precise cross from the left with a controlled volley on the opposite side of the box, the wing-back finds the bottom-left corner of Turner's goal!
GOOOAAALLL!!!	76'	Netherlands	2	-	1	USA	Haji Wright	USA · Striker #19	Asst: C. Pulisic	USA BACK IN IT! A first-time throughball by Yedlin - just on as a substitute - plays in Pulisic on the right, and his cutback from the byline loops up off Wright and spins over Noppert into the back of the net! Netherlands 2-1 USA, and there's all to play for now!
COMMENTARY	75'	OFF THE LINE! Wright is gifted a great chance to pull a goal back, but takes a heavy touch inside the box before seeing his low shot from a tight angle blocked away by that man Dumfries!
SUBSTITUTION	75'	IN	DeAndre Yedlin	USA · Defender #22	OUT	Sergiño Dest	USA · Defender #2	Dutch-born Dest has been unable to make much impact today, so Yedlin comes on for the latter stages.
COMMENTARY	72'	DOUBLE SAVE! The United States hang on by their fingertips, as Turner keeps their slim hopes alive! Following a save to his right from Koopmeiners' well-struck drive, he gets up quickly to repel Depay's diving header from close range! Brilliant goalkeeping!
SUBSTITUTION	67'	IN	Brenden Aaronson	USA · Midfielder #11	OUT	Timothy Weah	USA · Striker #21	After drifting out of the game somewhat, Weah will be replaced; Aaronson comes on.
SUBSTITUTION	67'	IN	Haji Wright	USA · Striker #19	OUT	Weston McKennie	USA · Midfielder #8	An attacking move by Berhalter sees McKennie replaced by a forward, Wright.
INSIGHTS	66'	Christian Pulisic has been involved in all three of USA's goals at the 2022 World Cup (1 goal, 2 assists)
COMMENTARY	61'	SAVE! At full stretch, Turner tips over a deflected drive by Depay, which seemed to be heading towards the crossbar. That's a corner for the Netherlands.
YELLOW CARD	60'	Teun Koopmeiners	Netherlands · Midfielder #20	For bringing down Pulisic with an ill-timed challenge, Koopmeiners picks up a yellow card.
INSIGHTS	59'	USA have now had eight shots on target in this game, their joint highest tally in a World Cup match on record (since 1966)
COMMENTARY	51'	SUPER SAVE! Turner demonstrates sharp reflexes, as he makes a stop at his near post when Zimmerman's attempted clearance almost sneaks by for an own goal!
COMMENTARY	50'	CLOSE! McKennie's header from the centre of the area is saved by Noppert, following a cross from Pulisic, then Ream sees a goalbound effort hacked away from near the goal-line!
INSIGHTS	46'	Timothy Weah (21/21) completed 100% of his passes while he was on the pitch - the only starting player to do so.
SUBSTITUTION	46'	IN	Teun Koopmeiners	Netherlands · Midfielder #20	OUT	Davy Klaassen	Netherlands · Midfielder #14	Despite - or perhaps because of - leading by two at half-time, Van Gaal makes a double change. Firat, Klaassen makes way for Koopmeiners.
SUBSTITUTION	46'	IN	Giovanni Reyna	USA · Midfielder #7	OUT	Jesus Ferreira	USA · Striker #9	The USA also make a switch for the second half: Ferreira makes way for Reyna up front.
SUBSTITUTION	46'	IN	Steven Bergwijn	Netherlands · Striker #7	OUT	Marten de Roon	Netherlands · Midfielder #15	De Roon is also replaced; Bergwijn comes on for the second half.
COMMENTARY	Half-time	Though this has been a finals of fightbacks and several shocks, the Netherlands are surely on their way to the quarter-finals following a ruthless display in the first half. Both engineered by Dumfries - the first ending a long one-touch move of some skill - their two goals have punished an energetic but toothless American side, who now have a mountain to climb after the interval. The USA spurned one great chance early on, but clearly lack a real cutting edge.
GOOOAAALLL!!!	45+1'	Netherlands	2	-	0	USA	Daley Blind	Netherlands · Midfielder #17	Asst: D. Dumfries	DOUBLE DUTCH DELIGHT! Outwitting his marker on the right byline, following a throw-in, Dumfries unlocks the States' defence once again. The wing-back cuts the ball back for Blind - chasing in from the opposite flank - who slots the ball into the bottom corner for his side's second goal! Just before the break, it's Netherlands 2-0 USA!!
COMMENTARY	43'	SMART STOP! A stinging shot from the right edge of the area by Weah scuds towards goal at high velocity, but Noppert responds by palming the ball away to his left! It was a save he should certainly make, but that was some hit from the USA striker!
INSIGHTS	22+1'	Daley Blind (32y 269d) has scored his first international goal in 74 appearances and becomes the second oldest goalscorer for Netherlands at the World Cup after Giovanni van Bronckhorst vs Uruguay in 2010 (35y 151d).
COMMENTARY	21'	MISS! By contrast with their move for the opening goal, the Netherlands get the ball forward early via a raking Van Dijk pass towards Depay on the right side of the box, but the latter fires his first-time shot several feet wide of the left-hand post.
INSIGHTS	15+1'	Netherlands have scored seven of their 10 shots on target at the 2022 World Cup
INSIGHTS	15'	There were 20 passes in the build up to Depay's opener, the longest passing sequence leading to a Netherlands goal on record (since 1966) at the World Cup.
INSIGHTS	10'	USA have never won a World Cup match in which they conceded the first goal (23 games - D5 L18)
INSIGHTS	10'	Memphis Depay has 34 goal involvements in his last 30 appearances in all competitions for Netherlands (24 goals, 10 assists)
GOOOAAALLL!!!	10'	Netherlands	1	-	0	USA	Memphis Depay	Netherlands · Striker #10	Asst: D. Dumfries	THE NETHERLANDS LEAD! A brilliant sweeping move of one-touch passing and movement puts the Netherlands in front! At the end of a rhythmic passing sequence which slices through the US defence, Depay receives the ball from Dumfries on the edge of the area and buries it in the bottom-left corner! What a beauty! Netherlands 1-0 USA!
COMMENTARY	3'	SAVE! After making most of the early running, the USA almost make a breakthrough! When Pulisic eludes the Dutch offside trap and finds himself free in the area, Noppert is alert enough to make a low save with his leg and repel the ball to safety!
INSIGHTS	1'	Memphis Depay is now the outright second top goalscorer for Netherlands with 43 goals, just seven behind Robin van Persie (50)
INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	All five previous meetings between Netherlands and USA have been in friendlies – Oranje won the first four between 1998 and 2010, with USA winning the most recent encounter in 2015.	2	Netherlands are unbeaten in their last 19 World Cup games against non-European nations (W13 D6) since a 3-2 loss to Brazil in the 1994 quarter-final. However, two of their six draws in this run have seen them eliminated on penalties (vs Brazil in 1998 and Argentina in 2014).	3	USA are winless in their last 11 World Cup games against European nations (D6 L5) since beating Portugal 3-2 in 2002. Overall, USA have won just three of their 23 World Cup games against European sides (D7 L13), also beating Belgium in 1930 and England in 1950.	4	Netherlands are unbeaten in all 10 of their World Cup matches under Louis van Gaal (W7 D3), keeping five clean sheets in their last six games at the finals, including shutouts in each of their last three in the knockout stages. The only side in World Cup history to keep four consecutive clean sheets in knockout games were Spain en route to winning the tournament in 2010.	5	Netherlands have reached at least the quarter-final in four of their last five appearances at the World Cup, failing only in 2006 in this run, losing 1-0 to Portugal in the round of 16.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	USA fans are relieved to see Pulisic named in their starting XI today, after suffering a pelvic injury as he scored the winner versus Iran. However, fellow forward Josh Sargent is sidelined by an ankle issue, so Ferreira makes his first start of the finals. Berhalter's only other change sees Zimmerman return for Carter-Vickers, who drops to the bench. Ajax academy product Dest lines up at right-back against the country of his birth, forming part of the second-youngest starting XI at Qatar 2022 so far, with an average age of 25 years, 86 days.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Though several Dutch players were apparently suffering flu-like symptoms earlier this week, Van Gaal has been able to name a side unchanged from that which started the win over Qatar. Therefore, Depay and Golden Boot candidate Gakpo join forces up front, while Timber holds off the challenge of De Ligt to start in the back three. Both the latter and Ake would miss a potential quarter-final tie should they receive a yellow card today.
