INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	Spain’s victory over Costa Rica is their biggest in the World Cup, and the biggest in the competition since Portugal beat DPR Korea by the same scoreline in 2010.	2	This is Costa Rica’s biggest defeat in the World Cup, with them conceding as many goals tonight as they did in their previous eight games in the competition.	3	Spain scored three goals in the first half of a World Cup match for only the second time in their history, also doing so against Brazil in 1934. Spain were 3-0 up after 29 minutes against Brazil, compared with going 3-0 up inside 31 minutes tonight versus Costa Rica.
COMMENTARY	Post Match	Though met by little in the way of resistance, Spain put on a passing masterclass in their opening match of the 2022 World Cup, and show a clinical side in hitting hapless Costa Rica for seven. After Olmo's early goal broke the deadlock, Luis Enrique's side pushed forward relentlessly and dominated the ball to an almost comical extent - the Costa Ricans barely had a kick, and failed to manage even a single shot at goal. With several young starlets impressing for La Roja, the stage is now set for a seismic clash with Germany this weekend.
YELLOW CARD	90+7'	Joel Campbell	Costa Rica · Striker #12	For bringing down Balde with a late challenge just outside his own area, Campbell is booked.

GOOOAAALLL!!!	90+2'	Spain	7	-	0	Costa Rica	Álvaro Morata	Spain · Striker #7	Asst: D. Olmo	SPAIN STRIKE SEVEN! Morata gets in on the act now, as his run off the defender's shoulder is met with a precise throughball from Olmo, and he then slots the ball past Navas and into the bottom-left corner! Spain 7-0 Costa Rica!!
GOOOAAALLL!!!	90'	Spain	6	-	0	Costa Rica	Carlos Soler	Spain · Midfielder #19	SPAIN HIT SIX! Substitute Soler adds another for La Roja, as Navas can't fully clear a low cross whipped over from the right by Williams, and the Valencia midfielder coolly steers the ball into the bottom corner from close range! That puts Spain 6-0 up, and Costa Rica just want this game to end!
INSIGHTS	84+3'	Spain have scored 5+ goals in a World Cup match for just the third time, after 1986 v Denmark (5-1) and 1998 v Bulgaria (6-1).

Not only La Roja's youngest-ever player at a World Cup, the Barcelona wonderkid adds a goal from Morata's cross! Spain 5-0 Costa Rica!

INSIGHTS	68'	Gavi (18 yrs 110d)has become the third youngest player to score in a World Cup match, behind Pele (17 yrs 239d) and Manuel Rosas (18 yrs 99d).
YELLOW CARD	68'	Francisco Calvo	Costa Rica · Defender #15	For a crunching challenge on substitute Soler, Calvo becomes the first player to receive a yellow card today.
SUBSTITUTION	64'	IN	Koke	Spain · Midfielder #8	OUT	Sergio Busquets	Spain · Midfielder #5	Busquets receives a warm round of applause as he wanders to the touchline, to be replaced by Koke.
SUBSTITUTION	64'	IN	Alejandro Balde	Spain · Defender #14	OUT	Jordi Alba	Spain · Defender #18	Replaced by his club-mate Balde on the left flank, Alba is the latest Spanish player to be rested.
COMMENTARY	63'	WIDE! A cute throughball by Azpilicueta towards the right side of the area finds Morata in some space, but the Spain striker thumps the ball wide of the right-hand post from an ever-closing angle.
SUBSTITUTION	61'	IN	Bryan Ruiz	Costa Rica · Striker #10	OUT	Jewison Bennette	Costa Rica · Midfielder #9	Teenage record-setter Bennette is also withdrawn, with the far more experienced Ruiz thrown on in his place.

GOOOAAALLL!!!	54'	Spain	4	-	0	Costa Rica	Ferran Torres	Spain · Striker #11	FOUR FOR SPAIN! Aided by some awful defending, Torres strikes again to put Spain 4-0 up with his 15th international goal. Having bundled his way into the box, Oviedo fails to deal with the forward's turn and allows him to turn the ball past a helpless Navas from close range!
INSIGHTS	53'	Gavi (18 yrs 110d)has become the third youngest player to score in a World Cup match, behind Pele (17 yrs 249d) and Manuel Rosas (18 yrs 99d).

INSIGHTS	45'	Costa Rica have failed to have an attempt at goal in the first half of a World Cup match for the first time since 1990 v Sweden.
COMMENTARY	Half-time	An exhibition of all that's admired about Spanish football puts La Roja into an unassailable lead in their World Cup opener, and with the second half still to play, surely all three points are already assured. Bringing up their nation's century of World Cup goals, Spain took the initiative early thanks to Olmo and went on to dominate events throughout. It has been mesmerising stuff at times, but a timid Costa Rica's passivity has certainly helped.
INSIGHTS	31'	This is the fastest (31 minutes) any side have gone 3-0 up in a World Cup match since Germany v Brazil in 2014 (24 mins).
GOOOAAALLL!!!	31'	Spain	3	-	0	Costa Rica	Ferran Torres	Spain · Striker #11	Penalty Goal	SPAIN LEAD BY THREE! Outfoxing Navas with a skip at the end of his run-up, Torres dinks the ball into the back of the net from the penalty spot and puts his nation three goals to the good!
COMMENTARY	29'	PENALTY FOR SPAIN! On his latest burst into the box, Alba tempts Duarte into a desperate lunge, and goes down when the latter catches his heel. The referee doesn't hesitate - that's a spot-kick for Spain!
INSIGHTS	27'	Spain have scored twice in the first half of a World Cup game for the first time since 2010 v Chile.
INSIGHTS	21'	Marco Asensio is Spain's 50th different goalscorer at the World Cup (excl. own goals)
GOOOAAALLL!!!	21'	Spain	2	-	0	Costa Rica	Marco Asensio	Spain · Striker #10	Asst: J. Alba	ASENSIO STRIKES! Spain go 2-0 up! Alba's low cross from the left edge of the area slices through the rather static Costa Rica defence, and Asensio reacts first to sweep the ball home via a desperate fingertip from Navas. The veteran goalkeeper can only guide it into the bottom corner, and his side trail by two!
INSIGHTS	11'	Spain have scored three goals in the first half of a World Cup match for only the second time in their history, also doing so against Brazil in 1934.
INSIGHTS	11'	Dani Olmo's 11th minute strike is Spain's earliest goal in a World Cup match since 2002 (Morientes v Rep Ireland in the 8th minute).
INSIGHTS	11'	Spain have become the 6th nation to score 100 goals at the World Cup, after Germany, Brazil, Italy, Argentina and France.
GOOOAAALLL!!!	11'	Spain	1	-	0	Costa Rica	Dani Olmo	Spain · Striker #21	SPAIN LEAD! As reward for their incessant attacking from the first whistle, La Roja go ahead early on! Gavi finds a yard of space just outside the area and chips a delicate ball over the top, which then deflects into the path of Olmo, who calmly steers the ball past an exposed Navas! Spain's 100th World Cup goal puts them 1-0 up!
COMMENTARY	9'	CLOSE! A masterful first-time reverse pass by Pedri picks out Asensio in the centre, but the makeshift forward snatches at his shot, which drifts just wide of the right-hand post with Navas diving down to his left at full stretch.
COMMENTARY	5'	MISS! A perceptive ball across from the left-centre by Pedri drops perfectly into the path of Olmo, who charges in to meet it at the far post. However - unmarked - he side-foots the ball wide of the left-hand post before grasping his head in his hands! That's a great chance spurned early on!
INSIGHTS	1'	Spain are the first European side to name two teenagers (Gavi and Pedri) in their starting XI for a World Cup match since Bulgaria against England in 1962 (Jechev and Sokolov).
INSIGHTS	1'	Both Spain and Costa Rica have named their youngest ever players in a World Cup match, in Gavi (18y 110 days) and Jewison Bennette (18y 161d) respectively.
INSIGHTS	0'	It's the first time three teenagers start a World Cup match since 1994, Cameroon vs Brazil (Kalla, Foe, Song all for Cameroon).
INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	This is the first encounter between Spain and Costa Rica at the FIFA World Cup. In their three meetings – all friendlies – Spain are unbeaten against the Central American side (W2 D1).	2	Spain are facing Costa Rica for the fourth time since 2011. Their three previous head-to-heads have produced 12 goals, an average of four per game.	3	Spain have qualified for their 16th FIFA World Cup, and their 12th in a row, their longest ever streak of participations in the tournament. Only Brazil (22), Germany (18) and Argentina (13) are currently on longer runs.	4	Spain won the FIFA World Cup in 2010. This is the only time they have reached the semis in their last 13 participations. They have, nevertheless, finished top of their group in four of their last five appearances.	5	Spain’s next goal at the FIFA World Cup will be their 100th in the tournament. José Iraragorri scored their first in 1934, in a 3-1 round of 16 victory against Brazil.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Costa Rica also select their youngest-ever player in a World Cup fixture, as winger Bennette - just 51 days older than Spain's Gavi - features on the flank. Ruiz has played in eight World Cup matches across the 2014 and 2018 editions, and will tie Christian Bolanos as Los Ticos' record-holder in terms of appearances should he come on from the bench.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	As expected, Spain have named their youngest ever player to play in a World Cup match, as Gavi (18 years 110 days) features in a midfield trio, joining club-mates Busquets and Pedri. Meanwhile, Manchester City midfielder Rodri starts at centre-back, with Asensio selected ahead of Morata to play in the centre of a front three - though Luis Enrique says his position should not be described as a 'false nine'. Azpilicueta beats Carvajal to a start at right-back.
