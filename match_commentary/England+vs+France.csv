COMMENTARY	Post Match	France are through to the semi-finals of the World Cup after a 2-1 win over England. The holders broke the deadlock in the 17th minute through Tchouameni's long-range strike into the bottom corner. England made a bright start to the second half, though, and were awarded a penalty after Saka was tripped, and Kane fired it into the back of the net. Giroud restored France's lead in the 78th minute with a header from close range and the Three Lions had another chance to equalise from the spot, but Kane blazed that one high over the bar.
