INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	France are now unbeaten in each of their last eight first round group stage matches at the World Cup (W6 D2), their longest such run since a stretch of eight games between 1982 and 1998 (W6 D2 also).	2	Denmark have lost their first World Cup game since their final fixture at the 2010 tournament against Japan. Indeed, they conceded as many goals tonight (2) as they did in their previous five games in the competition (also 2).	3	France are now just the fifth reigning champions at the World Cup to win their opening two games at the tournament after Italy in 1938, Uruguay in 1954, Brazil in 1998 and Brazil in 2006.
COMMENTARY	Post Match	A brace from Mbappe earns all three points for France, who edge past Denmark 2-1 at Stadium 974. After a first half that had promise but lacked clinical finishing, the two sides shifted into life after the restart with both teams confident in their ability to win the match. Mbappe gave his nation the lead just after the hour, linking up with Hernandez during a counter-attack before beating Schmeichel with a close-range shot but Hjulmand’s team were not to be denied - equalising seven minutes later. Eriksen’s corner found its intended target, with Andersen’s flick-on supplying Christensen with the chance to beat Lloris. The result would be decided four minutes from time though, with the PSG forward latching onto Griezmann’s cross to turn the ball over the line. The win guarantees France’s passage to the knockouts, while Denmark must beat Australia on the final day.

COMMENTARY	Half-time	An entertaining first half at Stadium 974 comes to a close with France and Denmark locked in a 0-0 draw. Despite near-identical possession statistics, most of the chances came one way as Deschamps’ side fashioned a number of goal-worthy opportunities, with Dembele playing provider for both Mbappe and Giroud; with both of them failing to convert partly thanks to Schmeichel’s great form. Hjulmand’s side looked to control the tempo with short passes through the middle and overlapping wing play, though they’ll need a bit more conviction if they wish to take the three points.

The two work a passing move down the pitch to evade Varane, putting the striker in a spot to trouble Lloris but the striker sends his effort whistling wide!
YELLOW CARD	23'	Andreas Cornelius	Denmark · Striker #21	Cornelius steps in to win the ball from Giroud but misses his attempt, instead catching the ankle of the Milan striker. It’s a yellow card for the Denmark forward - the second for Hjulmand’s side in three minutes.
COMMENTARY	22'	FANTASTIC SAVE! Griezmann fires his free-kick from deep in midfield out to the right for Dembele, who puts the ball on his left foot to hook an inswinging cross.

INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	This will be the fourth meeting between France and Denmark at the FIFA World Cup, all in the group stage of the competition. France have gone on to win the tournament on two of the previous occasions they’ve faced Denmark (1998 and 2018), with the other coming as reigning champions in 2002.	2	Denmark have won their last two meetings with France in all competitions, both in the 2022 UEFA Nations League. They've never won three in a row against them before, while no side has ever beaten France three times in the same calendar year.	3	This is the third time Denmark have faced the reigning world champions at the FIFA World Cup – they lost 3-2 to Brazil in the 1998 quarter-final, before beating France 2-0 in the 2002 group stages.	4	France have won each of their last five World Cup games; they have never won six in a row at the finals, with the last nation to do so being Spain in 2010.	5	Each of Denmark's last four World Cup games has been drawn – only Belgium have ever had five consecutive draws at the tournament, doing so between 1998 and 2002.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Denmark make four changes to the line-up that earned a 0-0 draw with Tunisia on Tuesday.

The final swap is at left-back, where Theo Hernandez takes over for his injured brother Lucas.
