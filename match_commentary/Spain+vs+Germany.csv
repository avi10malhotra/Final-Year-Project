INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	Germany have failed to win their first two group stage matches at a single World Cup for the first time in their history.	2	Spain have only lost three of their last 19 games in the group stage of a World Cup tournament (W12 D4) and are unbeaten in six group matches (W3 D3) since losing against Chile in 2014.	3	Germany are without a clean sheet in competitive matches in this calendar year (eight games). The last time the DFB team recorded a competitive clean sheet was back in November 2021 in a World Cup qualifier against Liechtenstein (9-0).
COMMENTARY	Post Match	The spoils are shared. Spain took the lead early in the second half through Morata only for Fullkrug to equalise for Germany inside the final 10 minutes. In truth, a draw is a fair result and keeps Germany alive heading into the final game of the group phase. Spain are top of Group E, but haven't yet confirmed their place in the Round of 16.
INSIGHTS	90+6'	Niclas Füllkrug has scored Germany's first World Cup goal by a substitute since the 2014 World Cup final against Argentina (Mario Götze)
INSIGHTS	84+6'	Alvaro Morata is the fifth player to score in his first two World Cup appearances for Spain after Fernando Torres, Basora, Zarra, and Jon Andoni Goikoetxea. He's the first of those five to score both times as a sub.
SUBSTITUTION	87'	IN	Nico Schlotterbeck	Germany · Defender #23	OUT	David Raum	Germany · Defender #3	Schlotterbeck has replaced Raum in a defensive change for Germany.

GOOOAAALLL!!!	83'	Spain	1	-	1	Germany	Niclas Füllkrug	Germany · Striker #9	Asst: J. Musiala	GOAL! Fullkrug equalises for Germany. The substitute comes steaming into the box, taking the ball off Musiala's toe before smashing it into the back of the net.

COMMENTARY	74'	CHANCE! Musiala is played in to a dangerous area, steadying himself before pulling the trigger and drawing a fine save from Simon. Big chance.
SUBSTITUTION	70'	IN	Lukas Klostermann	Germany · Defender #16	OUT	Thilo Kehrer	Germany · Defender #5	Klostermann has come in for Kehrer, who was on a yellow card.
SUBSTITUTION	70'	IN	Niclas Füllkrug	Germany · Striker #9	OUT	Thomas Müller	Germany · Striker #13	Fullkrug has replaced Muller to bring something different to Germany's attack.

INSIGHTS	66'	Álvaro Morata has scored eight goals at EURO's and World Cups, at least double the amount of any other player for Spain since 2016.
COMMENTARY	66'	CHANCE! Alba plays a cross-field pass that Gavi, aware of Asensio behind him, lets run. But Asensio's effort is miscued and flies wide of the target.
SUBSTITUTION	66'	IN	Koke	Spain · Midfielder #8	OUT	Marco Asensio	Spain · Striker #10	Koke has replaced Asensio to bring a steady hand to Spain's midfield.
SUBSTITUTION	66'	IN	Nico Williams	Spain · Striker #12	OUT	Gavi	Spain · Midfielder #9	Williams has come in for Gavi to offer an attacking spark out wide.
GOOOAAALLL!!!	62'	Spain	1	-	0	Germany	Álvaro Morata	Spain · Striker #7	Asst: J. Alba	GOAL! Spain take the lead. Alba is played in down the left flank by Busquets before lifting his head and crossing the ball to find Morata in the box. He times his run to perfection before directing his first-time finish into the back of the net.
YELLOW CARD	60'	Joshua Kimmich	Germany · Midfielder #6	Kimmich is issued a yellow card after a late tackle on Olmo.
YELLOW CARD	58'	Leon Goretzka	Germany · Midfielder #8	Goretzka is booked for bringing down Asensio to kill a break.
COMMENTARY	56'	CHANCE! Simon gives the ball away cheaply to Gundogan, who then quickly plays it to Kimmich. His shot from inside the box is saved by Simon.
SUBSTITUTION	54'	IN	Álvaro Morata	Spain · Striker #7	OUT	Ferran Torres	Spain · Striker #11	Morata has replaced Ferran up front for Spain.
INSIGHTS	Half-time	Germany have a possession figure of 31.6% at half-time - their lowest possession figure on record (1966 onwards) at the end of a World Cup match is 39% against Morocco in 1986.
COMMENTARY	Half-time	Interesting first half. Spain have seen the majority of the ball, but haven't been able to really carve open their opponents - save for one Olmo effort that was pushed onto the crossbar by Neuer. Germany had the ball in the net through Rudiger, only for VAR to intervene and rule it out for offside. The second half is perfectly poised.
YELLOW CARD	44'	Sergio Busquets	Spain · Midfielder #5	Busquets is issued a yellow card for bringing down Musiala to kill a break.
COMMENTARY	40'	GOAL DISALLOWED! Germany thought they had taken the lead when Rudiger's header hit the back of the net following Kimmich's free-kick. But VAR rules it out for offside.
NO GOAL	40'	No goal! After a VAR review, a goal for Germany is ruled out.
YELLOW CARD	37'	Thilo Kehrer	Germany · Defender #5	Kehrer is booked for a poor challenge on Ferran.
COMMENTARY	34'	CHANCE! Olmo is played in down the left flank and does well to square the ball for Ferran, who misses a chance he really should have scored. But the linesman's flag is raised and it turns out the goal would have been ruled out for offside in any case.
COMMENTARY	24'	CHANCE! Simon gives the ball away cheaply to Gnabry at the edge of the area. His left-footed effort is well wide of the target, however.
COMMENTARY	22'	CHANCE! Busquets plays a nice ball out wide left for Alba, who comes in on his weaker right foot before shooting from distance. His effort, however, flies wide.
INSIGHTS	12'	Germany's starting XI has an average age of 28 years and 147 days. The last time a DFB XI was this old in a FIFA World Cup match was on 30th June 2002 in the World Cup final against Brazil (28 years and 166 days).
INSIGHTS	7'	Dani Olmo's seventh-minute shot against Germany came after a sequence of 35 uninterrupted passes, the joint-longest such sequence for a shot or goal at the 2022 World Cup, alongside Jack Grealish's goal vs Iran.
COMMENTARY	6'	CHANCE! Pedri, Gavi and Asensio combine intelligently before playing the ball out wide left to Olmo, whose scorching effort from outside the box is pushed onto the crossbar by Neuer.
INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	This will be the fifth meeting between Spain and Germany at the FIFA World Cup, the joint-most that Spain have faced any side at the competition (also 5 vs Brazil). They failed to win any of their first three against Germany (D1 L2) but won the most recent encounter 1-0 in the 2010 semi-final en route to lifting the trophy.	2	Germany have won just one of their last seven meetings with Spain in all competitions (D2 L4), winning 1-0 in a friendly match in November 2014. They’ve not won a competitive meeting with Spain since EURO 1988 (2-0), drawing two and losing three since then.	3	Germany have lost three of their last four World Cup games, as many as they had in their previous 21. They've lost two in a row in the competition for just the third time (also in 1958 and 1982), and have never lost three consecutive World Cup games before.	4	Spain won their opening game of the 2022 World Cup against Costa Rica 7-0, their biggest ever win in the finals. On only three previous World Cup editions have Spain won both of their opening two matches: 1950, 2002 and 2006.	5	Germany have lost their opening group stage game in both 2018 and 2022, having lost their first game in just one of their previous 18 appearances in the World Cup. They've never lost consecutive group stage games in the same edition of the competition before.
