INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	Argentina have won the most penalty shootouts of any side in World Cup history (5 wins from 6), while only Spain (4) have lost more penalty shootouts at the World Cup than Netherlands (1 win from 4).	2	Argentina have progressed from a World Cup quarter-final for the fourth time – they went on to reach the final in each of the previous three instances (1986, 1990, 2014).	3	There were 15 cards shown to players that entered the field of play in this match, the most in World Cup history, overtaking Cameroon-Germany in 2002 (14 – 12 yellows and 2 reds).
COMMENTARY	Post Match	It's all over, and Argentina squeeze their way home as they progress to the last four! The Oranje's late comeback, and the two goals from Wout Weghorst right at the very end looked to have swung momentum in their favour, but couldn't find another in the half-hour of extra time. Penalties inevitably came, and two wonderful Emi Martinez saves gave his side the advantage, with the Albiceleste edging a 4-3 victory in the shoot-out to set up a semi-final showdown with Croatia.

COMMENTARY	120+1'	OFF THE POST! Another corner comes to the edge of the box, where Fernandez has another attempt at goal. This one flies through the crowd of bodies, and beats Noppert, but cannons back off the base of the post and bounces behind!
COMMENTARY	120'	WIDE! Argentina recycle the ball once again and Di Maria finds Messi. He steps beyond his marker before firing a shot low, and a slight deflection takes it wide of the right-hand post.
COMMENTARY	119'	SAVED! Fernandez squeezes a pass through to Lautaro Martinez, who turns Timber superbly before shooting. It's a good effort, but Noppert gets a strong hand to the ball and parries it away for a throw-in.
COMMENTARY	115'	BLOCKED! Argentina's latest corner is played back to Fernandez on the edge of the box, whose low shot on goal takes a wicked deflection off Weghorst, before looping over Noppert and onto the top of the net.
COMMENTARY	114'	BLOCKED! Fernandez does well to pick up Di Maria's pass and beat Lang down the right-hand side of the box. He cuts the ball back to Lautaro Martinez, whose first-time shot is deflected wide by Van Dijk.
SUBSTITUTION	113'	IN	Noa Lang	Netherlands · Midfielder #12	OUT	Cody Gakpo	Netherlands · Midfielder #8	Gakpo is brought off in a late, risky change by Louis Van Gaal, and Noa Lang will come on for the last few moments here.
YELLOW CARD	112'	Germán Pezzella	Argentina · Defender #6	Pezzella slides in on Gakpo, and despite getting some of the ball, brings Gakpo down awkwardly and concedes a yellow card-worthy free-kick.
SUBSTITUTION	112'	IN	Ángel Di María	Argentina · Midfielder #11	OUT	Lisandro Martínez	Argentina · Defender #25	Argentina make one last throw of the dice, bringing Lisandro Martinez off for Angel Di Maria to come into the attack.
COMMENTARY	110'	OVER!!! Messi plays a one-two form the free-kick and cuts inside upon getting the ball back. He looks to find the top corner, but sends his curling effort over the bar.
YELLOW CARD	109'	Gonzalo Montiel	Argentina · Defender #4	Montiel is nudged over by Gakpo to win a free-kick, but reacts aggressively and is the latest player to go into the book.
COMMENTARY	Break	The first period of extra-time ends, with the cagey nature of the first half of normal time returning to the fray. It's been passive from both sides so far, with each set of players clearly nervy after that high-octane end to the 90. We're 15 minutes away from penalties, folks, and the players will soon be taking that long walk, unless someone can conjure up some magic beforehand.
SUBSTITUTION	105'	IN	Gonzalo Montiel	Argentina · Defender #4	OUT	Nahuel Molina	Argentina · Defender #26	Argentina's first scorer Molina comes off at half-time in extra time, and Gonzalo Montiel will see out the game in his place.
COMMENTARY	104'	CHANCE!!! Messi floats a free-kick into the box, with Otamendi advancing at the far post. He stretches to connect with all his might, but can't make contact with the ball as it flies behind!
INSIGHTS	11'	No player has conceded more fouls at the 2022 World Cup than Jurriën Timber (16, level with teammate Denzel Dumfries).
INSIGHTS	7'	Argentina have not attempted a shot since their second goal.
YELLOW CARD	90+14'	Steven Bergwijn	Netherlands · Striker #7	Van Dijk is also booked for dissent, right at the end of a game this referee won't reflect on with too much fondness.
INSIGHTS	90+11'	Wout Weghorst has become the first ever substitute to score a brace in a World Cup match for Netherlands.
YELLOW CARD	90+11'	Nicolás Otamendi	Argentina · Defender #19	Otamendi's not happy with the goal, and the referee's not happy with him, booking the Albiceleste centre-back in the dying moments.
GOOOAAALLL!!!	90+11'	Netherlands	2	-	2	Argentina	Wout Weghorst	Netherlands · Striker #19	Asst: T. Koopmeiners	GOOOOOOOOAAAAAALLLLL!!!!!!!! They have done it!!!! Shaping to shoot, Koopmeiners instead rolls the ball right next to the wall, where Weghorst takes a touch before slotting the ball into the bottom corner to make it 2-2!!! What drama in Lusail, and we're locked up and level with just seconds to play!
YELLOW CARD	90+10'	Lionel Messi	Argentina · Striker #10	Messi is booked by the referee for dissent after arguing against the free-kick being given, and showing how nervous Argentina are about this chance.
COMMENTARY	90+3'	BLOCKED!!! Gakpo, Koopmeiners and Berghuis all stand over the free-kick, but the latter strikes it, and cannons the ball straight into the Argentine wall.
INSIGHTS	80+11'	Wout Weghorst is the first Netherlands substitute to score a brace in a World Cup game
YELLOW CARD	89'	Leandro Paredes	Argentina · Midfielder #5	It's all going off here!!! Ake fouls Paredes, who reacts by blasting the ball straight into the crowd on the Dutch bench. He's soon set upon by all of them and is barged over by Van Dijk, and the referee again has to wade in to separate the players, and books Paredes before the game can continue.
YELLOW CARD	88'	Steven Berghuis	Netherlands · Striker #11	Messi looks to duck and weave his way between Ake and Berghuis, but he's blocked off from his run by the latter, who is yellow-carded.
COMMENTARY	85'	WIDE!!!! What an effort!!! Gakpo's ball into the box is headed back by Luuk de Jong, and Berghuis arrives late to rifle a stinging volley into the side netting! The ball took a small deflection as it flew through the air, meaning it's a corner to the Oranje!
INSIGHTS	83'	Wout Weghorst scored with his first shot at the World Cup.
GOOOAAALLL!!!	83'	Netherlands	1	-	2	Argentina	Wout Weghorst	Netherlands · Striker #19	Asst: S. Berghuis	GOOOOAAALLL!!! Hang on a moment!!! Berghuis curls a belter of a cross from deep and Weghorst races to the front post. His flicked, glancing header is an absolute peach, and bounces beyond Emi Martinez into the far corner! 2-1, and the Dutch are certainly back in this one now!
SUBSTITUTION	82'	IN	Lautaro Martínez	Argentina · Striker #22	OUT	Julián Álvarez	Argentina · Striker #9	Alvarez hasn't found the net in this game, but has still been a crucial cog up front, and Lautaro Martinez replaces the Manchester City man up in attack.
INSIGHTS	77+4'	Argentina have made 307 successful passes in this match - their lowest tally at this World Cup.

YELLOW CARD	76'	Memphis Depay	Netherlands · Striker #10	Depay was heavily involved in that resultant scuffle, and as a result is shown a yellow card by the referee.
YELLOW CARD	76'	Lisandro Martínez	Argentina · Defender #25	The former Manchester United winger is joined in the book by a current Red Devil, as Lisandro Martinez is also shown a yellow card.
INSIGHTS	73'	Wout Weghorst's goal was Netherlands' first shot on target in this match.
INSIGHTS	73'	Lionel Messi has drawn level with Gabriel Batistuta as the joint-highest scorer for Argentina at World Cup finals (10).
GOOOAAALLL!!!	73'	Netherlands	0	-	2	Argentina	Lionel Messi	Argentina · Striker #10	Penalty Goal	GOOOAAALLL!!!! Argentina double their lead!!! Messi steps up with all the calmness and composure we've come to expect, and buries his penalty right into the corner. Noppert is rooted to the spot, but Argentina certainly aren't, as they've got at least one foot in the semi-finals now!
COMMENTARY	71'	PENALTY!!! Acuna dribbles into the box and looks to turn Dumfries, but is brought down by the Dutch defender's trailing leg, and the referee points to the spot as a result! Messi will step up for Argentina, with the chance to all-but seal their passage to the semi-finals!
SUBSTITUTION	66'	IN	Leandro Paredes	Argentina · Midfielder #5	OUT	Rodrigo De Paul	Argentina · Midfielder #7	De Paul comes off after another industrious performance in the middle of the park, and he's replaced by Leandro Paredes for the Albiceleste.
SUBSTITUTION	64'	IN	Luuk de Jong	Netherlands · Striker #9	OUT	Daley Blind	Netherlands · Midfielder #17	The Dutch look to the skies as they bring off Blind for towering PSV striker Luuk de Jong, who will certainly provide them with more of an outlet to aim at up front.
COMMENTARY	63'	OVER!!! How close! Messi steps up to take the free-kick he won, and whips the ball over the wall, and beyond Noppert, but over the bar as it brushes the top of the net and rattles the rear stanchion!
INSIGHTS	59'	Argentina have faced just one shot in this match - the fewest Lionel Scaloni's side have faced at the 2022 World Cup
INSIGHTS	55'	Netherlands are yet to take a shot from inside the box.
COMMENTARY	51'	CHANCE!!! Argentina power forward and De Paul slips a pass in behind Ake for Messi to chase. The captain does so, but Noppert races off his line to smother the ball before he can latch onto it!

SUBSTITUTION	46'	IN	Teun Koopmeiners	Netherlands · Midfielder #20	OUT	Marten de Roon	Netherlands · Midfielder #15	De Roon is also withdrawn, replaced in midfield by Teun Koopmeiners.
INSIGHTS	Half-time	One shot is Netherlands' joint-fewest in the first half of a World Cup game since 1966 (four occasions).
INSIGHTS	Half-time	Argentina have not conceded a first half goal in each of their first five games at a World Cup for the first time since 1990, when they reached the final.
INSIGHTS	Half-time	Argentina made just 179 successful passes in the opening 45 minutes - their lowest first half tally at the 2022 World Cup.
COMMENTARY	Half-time	The first half ends, with Argentina edging things on the scoreline thanks to Molina's opener. Messi, as ever, played the crucial role in setting up that goal, in a half which has otherwise been sparse of quality. The Dutch are yet to have a shot on target, while Argentina have also been limited in the final third, but with the deadlock broken, the game could well open up in the second half as these two fight to advance to the semi-finals.
YELLOW CARD	45+2'	Wout Weghorst	Netherlands · Striker #19	The referee again heads over to the bench to calm tensions, showing a yellow card to Netherlands' substitute striker Wout Weghorst.
COMMENTARY	45+1'	SAVED!!! Gakpo whips a free-kick into the Argentina box, which Emi Martinez does well to claim and hold. The Dutch claim Ake was fouled for a potential penalty, but to no avail from the referee or VAR.
YELLOW CARD	45'	Cristian Romero	Argentina · Defender #13	Depay looks to flick the ball over Romero's head, but the centre-back wildly sticks out an arm, which the ball hits, and rightfully receives a yellow card.
YELLOW CARD	43'	Marcos Acuña	Argentina · Defender #8	Acuna is also shown a yellow card for the incident, ruling him out of the semi-final - should Argentina get there, of course.
YELLOW CARD	43'	Jurrien Timber	Netherlands · Defender #2	Timber is clipped by Acuna on the touchline and reacts poorly, pushing the Argentina full-back to the ground. The referee spots this, and promptly books the Dutch defender.
COMMENTARY	40'	SAVED!!! A loose ball is latched onto by Alvarez, who surges down the left before passing inside to Messi. He holds off his marker to keep possession superbly, before turning and firing a right-footed shot into the gloves of Noppert.
INSIGHTS	35'	Netherlands have won three of their last four games at the World Cup when they have conceded first.
INSIGHTS	35'	Lionel Messi has just provided his seventh assist at the World Cup, with all seven goals coming from different scorers.

GOOOAAALLL!!!	35'	Netherlands	0	-	1	Argentina	Nahuel Molina	Argentina · Defender #26	Asst: L. Messi	GOOOOOAAAAALLL!!!!! There is the breakthrough for the Albiceleste!!! Messi drops a shoulder and darts through midfield, before threading a pass through the eye of a needle into the box. Molina latches onto it and steps beyond Blind, before stabbing the ball beyond Noppert to put Argentina 1-0 up!!! That's what we've been waiting for!
COMMENTARY	33'	SAVED!!! Argentina advance down the right through Mac Allister, who squares inside to Messi. He lays the ball off to De Paul, whose first-time shot is easily held by Noppert.
INSIGHTS	25'	Nahuel Molina has scored his first goal for Argentina in what is his 25th appearance for the national team.
INSIGHTS	25'	Neither side are yet to have a shot on target in this match.
COMMENTARY	24'	WIDE! Depay and Bergwijn link up well to move the ball forward, and the latter tries his luck, but drags his effort well wide of the target.
COMMENTARY	22'	OVER!!! Messi glides through the Dutch midfield before taking aim from the edge of the box. The defence stands off him, but the Argentina playmaker can only send his effort curling over the top.
INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	This will be the sixth World Cup meeting between Netherlands and Argentina, with only Brazil against Sweden (7) and Argentina against Germany (7) being played more often in the competition.	2	Netherlands have lost just one of their nine meetings with Argentina in all competitions (W4 D4), with that loss coming in the 1978 World Cup final. However, the most recent of those four draws did result in a penalty shootout defeat, in the last meeting between the sides in the 2014 World Cup semi-final.	3	The last two World Cup meetings between Netherlands and Argentina have finished 0-0, in the 2006 group stages and the 2014 semi-final (Argentina progressing on penalties).	4	Since losing the 1930 final against Uruguay, each of Argentina's last nine eliminations from the World Cup knockout rounds (including finals) have come against European nations, including a 2-1 loss to Netherlands in the 1998 quarter-final.	5	Netherlands have progressed from their last three World Cup quarter-final matches (1998, 2010, 2014), with their only defeat at this stage coming in 1994 against eventual winners Brazil.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	The Albiceleste also make one change, but it’s a defensive one, with Gomez withdrawn for Lisandro Martinez. He’ll form part of a five-man back-line, while Julian Alvarez and captain Lionel Messi, who both scored against Australia, will make up the front two, looking to do similar damage to the Dutch rearguard.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Cody Gakpo has been the Netherlands’ main man so far this tournament, but didn’t get on the scoresheet against the US as his strike partner Memphis Depay scored the opener. The Dutch’s sole change - Bergwijn in for Klaassen - sees Gakpo move into the middle of the front three, with Depay and Bergwijn on his left and right flanks respectively.
