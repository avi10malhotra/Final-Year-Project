INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	Ghana scored three goals in a single World Cup game for the first time in their history, while they’ve scored in each of their last seven World Cup matches overall – only Nigeria (8 between 1994 and 1998) have scored in more consecutive games among African nations in the competition.	2	Ghana became the first team to record consecutive 3-2 results at the World Cup (for or against) since Uruguay in 2010 and the fourth side overall to do so (also Germany in 1994 and Switzerland in 1934).	3	Korea Republic have won just one of their last 11 matches at the World Cup (D3 L7) and conceded as many goals today as they did in their previous four games in the competition (3).
COMMENTARY	Post Match	South Korea started the game well and looked more likely to score before Salisu broke the deadlock for Ghana in the 24th minute. Jordan Ayew sent in a dangerous free-kick into the six-yard box and South Korea failed to clear their lines. Salisu was quickest to react to the loose ball and fired home. Kudus then doubled Ghana's lead with a glancing header, once again from a Jordan Ayew cross. South Korea mounted a comeback early in the second half. Cho scored two headers either side of the hour mark, but they were only level for seven minutes as Kudus secured his own brace with a great finish past Kim Seung-gyu. South Korea tried to get a third but to no avail, as Ghana take all three points with a 3-2 win.

INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	This is the first meeting between Korea Republic and Ghana since a friendly in June 2014, with Jordan Ayew netting a hat-trick in a 4-0 win for the Black Stars.	2	Korea Republic have scored exactly twice in each of their three FIFA World Cup meetings with African nations, beating Togo 2-1 in 2006, drawing 2-2 with Nigeria in 2010, and losing 4-2 to Algeria in 2014.	3	Following their 2-0 win against Germany in 2018, and their 0-0 draw with Uruguay on MD1 this year, Korea Republic have kept a clean sheet in consecutive World Cup games for the first time. Their previous two shutouts in the competition came over a period of 16 games between 2002 and 2018.	4	Ghana are winless in their last five matches at the World Cup (D2 L3). Defeat here would see them exit in the group stages in consecutive appearances at the competition (also 2014), having reached the knockout rounds in both of their first two (2006 and 2010).	5	Korea Republic have failed to score in three of their last five World Cup games. On top of this, they've failed to register a shot on target in two of their last four (including in their 0-0 draw with Uruguay), having had at least one attempt on target in each of their last 29 games in the competition.

Addo also makes three changes as he switches from a back five to a back four. Ayew, Mensah, and Lamptey come into the starting lineup for Seidu, Djiku, and Baba Rahman.
