INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	17% of Poland’s games at the World Cup have finished goalless (6/35), the highest percentage of any team to play at least 15 games at the tournament.	2	Mexico have failed to score in each of their last three World Cup matches, the first time they have done so since another three-game run between 1966 and 1970.	3	Poland have failed to win their opening game at the World Cup in each of their last seven participations, a run that started in 1978 (D4 L3). They have scored just one goal across those seven matches.
COMMENTARY	Post Match	Mexico and Poland play out a goalless draw in their World Cup Group C clash at Stadium 974. Robert Lewandowski missed the best chance of the game as he failed to convert from the penalty spot after being fouled by Hector Moreno. Both teams struggled to create chances in the final third and the draw was the fair result in the end, allowing the two sides to add a point each to their tallies in their first match of the tournament.
INSIGHTS	90+7'	Alexis Vega had over half of Mexico's shots (5/9) before he was substituted.
COMMENTARY	90+6'	WIDE! Krychowiak advances through the middle of the park and has options. He goes alone with a powerful strike, but his effort just creeps wide of the target. Not a bad attempt.
SUBSTITUTION	87'	IN	Arkadiusz Milik	Poland · Striker #7	OUT	Piotr Zieliński	Poland · Midfielder #20	Zielinski has had better days on a football pitch. He makes way after a disappointing performance for Milik.
SUBSTITUTION	84'	IN	Uriel Antuna	Mexico · Striker #21	OUT	Alexis Vega	Mexico · Striker #10	Vega has worked hard today, but has lacked the final product. Antuna replaces him in the final third.
COMMENTARY	82'	BLOCK! Bereszynski rises highest in the box to head a corner from Zielinski towards the back post. Kiwior connects on the half-volley, but Sanchez makes a good block in the six-yard box.
COMMENTARY	80'	WIDE! Gallardo feeds a pass inside for the run of Vega, who looks to shoot from distance. It is ambitious and the forward can only slice his attempt well wide of the right post.
YELLOW CARD	76'	Przemysław Frankowski	Poland · Midfielder #24	Frankowski catches Lozano on the boot and goes into the book.
SUBSTITUTION	72'	IN	Przemysław Frankowski	Poland · Midfielder #24	OUT	Sebastian Szymański	Poland · Midfielder #19	Frankowski replaces Szymanski for Poland in the middle of the park.
SUBSTITUTION	71'	IN	Raúl Jiménez	Mexico · Striker #9	OUT	Henry Martín	Mexico · Striker #20	Jimenez enters the action for El Tri as he replaces Martin.
SUBSTITUTION	71'	IN	Carlos Alberto Rodríguez	Mexico · Midfielder #8	OUT	Héctor Herrera	Mexico · Midfielder #16	Herrera is withdrawn from the Mexico midfield and is replaced by Rodriguez.
COMMENTARY	64'	SAVE! Szczesny has to react quickly as Martin deflects a strike from Alvarez from distance towards goal. The Poland keeper has to be alert to palm it away from danger.
INSIGHTS	63'	Guillermo Ochoa is the first Mexico goalkeeper to save a World Cup penalty (excl. shootouts) on record (since 1966).
INSIGHTS	61'	Poland have now missed each of their last three World Cup penalties (excl. shootouts), with these coming in 1978, 2002 and 2022.
MISSED PENALTY	58'	Robert Lewandowski	Poland · Striker #9
COMMENTARY	56'	PENALTY TO POLAND! Poland are awarded a penalty as VAR and the referee deems that Moreno pulled back Lewandowski in the box as he tried to stretch to reach a loose ball.
YELLOW CARD	56'	Héctor Moreno	Mexico · Defender #15	Moreno goes into the book for pulling back Lewandowski in the penalty area.
PENALTY	55'	Penalty to Poland! After a VAR review, a penalty is awarded.
COMMENTARY	52'	SAVE! Lozano cuts in from the left flank and past two challenges. He lines up a drive at goal, but sees his curling strike saved by Szczesny.
SUBSTITUTION	46'	IN	Krystian Bielik	Poland · Midfielder #6	OUT	Nicola Zalewski	Poland · Midfielder #21	Zalewski is withdrawn at the break and is replaced by Bielik. This may require a re-shuffle in the ranks.
COMMENTARY	Half-time	It's goalless at the break between Mexico and Poland in their World Cup Group C clash. Neither side threatened in the opening 45 minutes outside of one late effort from Jorge Sanchez that Wojciech Szczesny turned over the bar. Mexico have seen more of the ball, but have lacked the cutting edge to cut open the Poland defence. The Poles have offered nothing going forward and will need to address that at the interval.
INSIGHTS	45+3'	Poland's one shot was the fewest they have ever had in a single half (excl. extra-time) of a World Cup match on record (since 1966).
INSIGHTS	45'	Aged 34 years and 292 days, Kamil Glik today becomes the oldest player to play for Poland in the World Cup, overtaking Jacek Zielinski v USA in 2002 (34y 247d).
COMMENTARY	45'	SAVE! Lozano offloads to Martin, who steers a pass into the feet of Sanchez. He forces a strike towards the near post that almost catches Szczesny out, but he turns the ball over the bar.
INSIGHTS	41+3'	Robert Lewandowski received 15 passes in the first half - 8 of those were from goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny (53%).
YELLOW CARD	29'	Jorge Sánchez	Mexico · Defender #19	Sanchez pulls back Szymanski and goes into the book. It is a harsh call on the Mexico right-back. Poland have a free-kick in a useful position.
COMMENTARY	28'	SCRAMBLE! Chavez clips a ball over the top for Gallardo, but Szczesny does enough to push it away. The rebound almost falls for the Mexico left-back, but Poland get men back to force the ball off the defender and behind for a goal-kick.
COMMENTARY	26'	CLOSE! Vega attacks a looping cross from Herrera from the inside-right channel and guides his header towards the far corner, only to see his effort drift inches wide of the target. Szczesny was scrambling and was relieved to see it travel past the post.
INSIGHTS	19'	Kamil Glik is the fifth player to reach 100 caps for Poland after Robert Lewandowski, Jakub Błaszczykowski, Michał Żewłakow and Grzegorz Lato.
INSIGHTS	16'	Aged 34 years and 292 days, Kamil Glik today becomes the oldest player to play for Poland in the World Cup, overtaking Jacek Zielinski v USA in 2002 (24y 247d).
COMMENTARY	5'	CHANCE! Kiwior loses possession and allows Lozano to raid down the right flank and fire the ball across the face of goal. Vega attacks the cross at the back post, but can only steer his effort wide.
INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	Mexico and Poland’s only previous FIFA World Cup meeting was in the group phase of the 1978 edition. Poland won 3-1.	2	Mexico will participate in the FIFA World Cup for the 17th time, while Qatar 2022 will be their eighth consecutive appearance in the finals. No team has played as many games as Mexico at the FIFA World Cup without ever reaching the final (57).	3	Mexico have progressed from their first-round group in each of their last eight FIFA World Cup appearances, last failing to do so in 1978. Indeed, the Tricolor have won their opening group stage match in five of their last six World Cups (D1).	4	Mexico kept more clean sheets during the third round of CONCACAF qualifying for this year’s FIFA World Cup than any other nation (eight), with only table toppers Canada (seven) conceding fewer goals at that stage than the Tricolor (eight).	5	Poland have qualified for their ninth FIFA World Cup; however, they haven’t made it past the group stages since 1986, losing eight of their last 11 matches at the tournament.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Poland have made seven changes to their side that beat Chile last time out. Szczesny comes into the side between the posts, while Bereszynski joins Kiwior and Glik in the backline. Cash and Zalewski get the starts in the wing-back positions and Kaminski slots into the midfield. Lewandowski and Zielinski lead the line for the Poles as Milik and Swiderski start on the bench.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Mexico lost 2-1 to Sweden in their final warm-up game before the tournament. From the side that was beaten last time out, Martino drafts in two changes. Alvarez starts in the middle of the park as Rodriguez drops to the bench. Antuna also makes way for El Tri in the final third as Lozano comes into the side.
