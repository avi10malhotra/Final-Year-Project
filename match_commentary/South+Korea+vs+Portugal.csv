INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	Portugal have lost a World Cup game in which they opened the scoring for the very first time (P18 W15 D3 before today), while Korea Republic have won a World Cup game in which they conceded first for the first time since 2006 against Togo (winless in 10 such matches before today).	2	Korea Republic have progressed beyond the first round group stage at the World Cup for just a third time (also in 2002 & 2010) in what is their 11th appearance at the tournament.	3	Despite today’s defeat, Portugal have finished top of their World Cup group (first round only) for a third time, previously doing so in 1966 and in 2006 (reaching the semi-final at both of those tournaments). 
COMMENTARY	Post Match	Portugal took the lead after just five minutes after Horta found the back of the net on his World Cup debut. South Korea equalised 20 minutes later after Kim Young-gwon reacted quickest to a mistake from Ronaldo. The first half was played at a very slow pace with both sides being very patient with their build-up play. Portugal were the more dominant side however, forcing Kim Seung-gyu into five saves. The second half was relatively quiet for the most part until Son Heung-min countered forward and Hwang Hee-chan scored the winner in the 91st minute to put South Korea through to the knockout rounds.
