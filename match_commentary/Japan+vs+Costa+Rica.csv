INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	Costa Rica have beaten Japan for the first time in all competitions (D1 L3), while they’ve won both their encounters against Asian teams at the World Cup (also beat China 2-0 in 2002)	2	Japan have lost both their matches against CONCACAF sides at the World Cup, also losing to Jamaica in 1998 (2-1).	3	Costa Rica became the first team to concede seven goals in a game, then win their next match at the World Cup since Paraguay in 1958 (lost 7-3 to France, won 3-2 against Scotland).
COMMENTARY	Post Match	A remarkable change of fortunes for both nations sees Costa Rica - thrashed by Spain in their opener - turn over Germany's conquerors Japan; scoring the winning goal late on, via their first shot on target of the tournament. After an admirable defensive display, Los Ticos made the most of an ineffective Japanese attack to absorb some second-half pressure and strike on the counter. Fuller's finish in the 81st minute sees the team which only squeezed into the finals with a playoff win over New Zealand move level on points with both Japan and Group E leaders Spain.
INSIGHTS	90+6'	Costa Rica's goal came from their first shot on target at the World Cup this year.
INSIGHTS	90+5'	Costa Rica are yet to take a shot from inside the box in this World Cup (3 from outside the box in the game against Japan).
SUBSTITUTION	90+5'	IN	Daniel Chacón	Costa Rica · Midfielder #2	OUT	Joel Campbell	Costa Rica · Midfielder #12	Campbell takes some warm applause from Los Ticos' rapturous fans, as Chacon comes on to replace the experienced striker and provide more defensive cover.
YELLOW CARD	90+3'	Wataru Endo	Japan · Midfielder #6	For a cynical - and successful - attempt to stop Costa Rica counter-attacking, Endo is shown a yellow card.
SUBSTITUTION	89'	IN	Youstin Salas	Costa Rica · Midfielder #14	OUT	Celso Borges	Costa Rica · Midfielder #5	As Costa Rica aim to hold on for a precious three points, Salas comes on to provide fresh legs; Borges is the man to be replaced.
COMMENTARY	88'	CLOSE! Japan almost equalise! After Mitoma cuts the ball back from the left byline, Kamada has a firm low shot blocked by Oviedo, then a scramble for the ball ultimately ends in the gloves of Navas near his goal-line - what an escape for Costa Rica!
YELLOW CARD	84'	Kou Itakura	Japan · Defender #4	For a clear foul on Bennette, Itakura is booked by the referee.
SUBSTITUTION	82'	IN	Takumi Minamino	Japan · Midfielder #10	OUT	Yuki Soma	Japan · Midfielder #24	Stung into action by seeing his side slip a goal behind, Moriaysu takes of Soma and replaces him with Monaco forward Minamino.
GOOOAAALLL!!!	81'	Japan	0	-	1	Costa Rica	Keysher Fuller	Costa Rica · Midfielder #4	Asst: Y. Tejeda	COSTA RICA LEAD! Incredibly, Costa Rica's first shot on target in the Qatar World Cup results in what could be a winning goal!! After Japan lose the ball, Fuller receives it from Tejeda on the brink of the box, then coolly curls the ball into the back of the net via Gonda's outstretched fingertips! Costa Rica 1-0 Japan!
YELLOW CARD	70'	Francisco Calvo	Costa Rica · Defender #15	Asano escapes on the edge of the area, and Calvo pulls his opponent back by the arm to halt his progress. Though fortunate not to be dismissed, the Costa Rica defender receives a booking and will be suspended for the game against Germany.
SUBSTITUTION	67'	IN	Junya Ito	Japan · Striker #14	OUT	Ritsu Doan	Japan · Midfielder #8	The series of substitutions continues: now, Doan is replaced by Ito. Japan have just one change left to make.
SUBSTITUTION	65'	IN	Jewison Bennette	Costa Rica · Striker #9	OUT	Anthony Contreras	Costa Rica · Striker #7	Contreras is also taken off, and young winger Bennette comes on for Los Ticos.
SUBSTITUTION	65'	IN	Brandon Aguilera	Costa Rica · Midfielder #20	OUT	Gerson Torres	Costa Rica · Midfielder #13	Suarez responds by making his first changes for Costa Rica, as Torres makes way for Aguilera.
SUBSTITUTION	62'	IN	Kaoru Mitoma	Japan · Midfielder #9	OUT	Miki Yamane	Japan · Defender #2	Japan make a third substitution, as Yamane makes way for Mitoma in midfield.
YELLOW CARD	61'	Celso Borges	Costa Rica · Midfielder #5	Having hacked down Endo on the edge of his own box, Borges is deservedly shown a yellow card and concedes a free-kick in a dangerous area.
COMMENTARY	48'	CHANCE! Just after Calvo makes a late block on a goalbound shot from Endo, Navas is again forced to work, as Asano turns a weak header towards the left-hand post!
COMMENTARY	46'	SAVE! After Asano flicks the ball through for Morita on the edge of the area, the latter stings the fingertips of Navas in the Costa Rica goal and the ball goes behind for a corner! Within seconds of the re-start we have our first shot on target!
SUBSTITUTION	46'	IN	Takuma Asano	Japan · Striker #18	OUT	Ayase Ueda	Japan · Striker #21	After an awful first half, Japan make two half-time changes. First, the ineffective Ueda makes way for Asano.
SUBSTITUTION	46'	IN	Hiroki Ito	Japan · Defender #26	OUT	Yuto Nagatomo	Japan · Defender #5	Veteran defender Nagatomo is also replaced; Ito comes on. This should herald a change of shape.
INSIGHTS	Half-time	Japan have conceded 12 fouls, the most of any side in the first half at the 2022 World Cup.
INSIGHTS	Half-time	This was the first World Cup match in 2022 that failed to see a shot on target from either side at half-time.
COMMENTARY	Half-time	Following eventful encounters in both teams' opening fixtures, today a lacklustre first half has exposed the shortcomings of both Japan and Costa Rica. While Moriyasu's men were unable to sustain their high tempo in the heat and have struggled to take the initiative, Suarez's side are steadfast in defence but lack a threat further up the field. In all, it's been a grim spectacle, with little to excite its global audience, so some changes in both personnel and system may be in order after the break.
YELLOW CARD	44'	Miki Yamane	Japan · Defender #2	Perhaps slightly harshly, Yamane is booked for a collision from behind on Campbell.
YELLOW CARD	41'	Anthony Contreras	Costa Rica · Striker #7	For a mistimed tackle on Yoshida in midfield, in which he makes contact with the Japan defender's lower shin, Contreras is shown the game's first yellow card.
INSIGHTS	32'	Only Neymar (9) has won more fouls in a World Cup game this year than Gerson Torres today (6). Only Joel Campbell has ever won more fouls in a World Cup game for Costa Rica (vs Uruguay and Greece in 2014, 7 in each).
INSIGHTS	25'	Japan goalkeeper Shuichi Gonda has had the fewest touches of any player so far (3).
INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	Japan have never lost in four previous meetings with Costa Rica in all competitions (W3 D1), netting exactly three goals in all three victories in this run.	2	Costa Rica won their only previous FIFA World Cup game against an Asian nation, beating China 2-0 in the 2002 edition.	3	After beating Germany 2-1 on MD1, Japan are looking to win back-to-back World Cup matches for the first time since 2002 (v Russia and Tunisia), while they have never won both of their first two fixtures of a single edition at the finals.	4	Costa Rica lost their opening match of the 2022 World Cup 7-0 to Spain, conceding as many goals in that match as their previous eight games at the tournament combined beforehand.	5	Since beating both Uruguay and Italy in their group in 2014, Costa Rica are winless in seven World Cup games (D4 L3), failing to score in five of those matches.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Suarez opts for only two changes to the Costa Rica side thumped by Spain last time out: Waston replaces Martinez at right-back, while Torres comes in for talented teenager Bennette out wide. A switch to a four-man defence could also be on the cards.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Japan make a total of five changes to the side which started against Germany, as Yamane, Morita, Soma, Ueda and goalscorer Doan all come into the first XI. Sakai and Tomiyasu both start on the bench, having been troubled by injuries this week. Meanwhile, vastly experienced 36-year-old Nagatomo features at left-back.
