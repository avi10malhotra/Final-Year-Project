INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	Morocco are the fourth African side to reach the quarter-final of a World Cup tournament, after Cameroon in 1990, Senegal in 2002 and Ghana in 2010.	2	Spain have been eliminated in three of their last four games in the round of 16 at the World Cup, losing on penalties at this stage in each of the last two editions (v Russia in 2018 and Morocco in 2022).	3	Morocco became the first African nation to win a penalty shootout at the World Cup, with this just the second one contested by an African side (previously Ghana 2-4 Uruguay in 2010).
COMMENTARY	Post Match	Morocco qualified for the quarter-finals of the World Cup for the first time after beating Spain on penalties. Stuck in their third for most of the game, they went close through Aguerd in the first half before surviving an onslaught. Having just one shot in the second half, Bounou pushed away Olmo’s powerful effort before Morata missed the target with a header. In extra-time, Simon made a point-blank save from Cheddira before Sarabia hit the post with the final kick to send the match to penalties. Spain faltered from the spot, failing to score any of their three penalties. Sarabia hit the post with Bounou saving spot-kicks from Soler and Busquets. Morocco were cool from 12 yards. Simon saved Benoun's effort, but composed strikes from Sabiri and Ziyech, and a chip from Hakimi sent Regragui’s side through.
INSIGHTS	Penalty Shootout	First time Spain's first penalty taker in a WC shootout has missed.
INSIGHTS	Penalty Shootout	The team going second has won the last 7 World Cup shootouts.

INSIGHTS	54'	Dani Olmo's 54th minute attempt was Spain's first shot on target of this game.
INSIGHTS	Half-time	Spain attempted just one shot in the first half (Marco Asensio, 26th minute), their fewest on record (since 1966) in the opening 45 minutes of a World Cup match.
COMMENTARY	Half-time	Spain dominated possession in the opening 45 minutes, but it was Morocco who looked the more dangerous on the attack. Having the first shot of the match, with Hakimi curling a free-kick over the bar, Mazraoui forced Simon into a save before Aguerd had a chance to score from close range. Latching onto a cross from the left by Boufal, the West Ham defender headed the ball wide. Spain’s only scoring opportunity of the first half came through Asensio, who broke free of the Moroccan defence before slamming the side of the net from a tight angle.
COMMENTARY	43'	WIDE! Morocco could have scored there! Hakimi's cross from the right is flicked towards Boufal by Busquets who tries to clear it away. The former Southampton man shifts it onto his left foot before crossing it to Aguerd who misses the target.
INSIGHTS	33'	Sofiane Boufal has completed more dribbles so far (4) than every other player on the field combined (3).
COMMENTARY	33'	SAVE! Simon is tested for the first time today. Mazraoui dispossesses Torres before unleashing a powerful effort from outside the box. The goalkeeper gets his body behind it, claiming it on the second attempt.
COMMENTARY	27'	WIDE! Big chance for Spain. Alba launches the ball down the left to Asensio who runs beyond the Moroccan defence. One-on-one with Bounou, he crashes the side of the net with his strike from a tight angle.
INSIGHTS	0'	Achraf Hakimi and Hakim Ziyech are making their 7th World Cup appearances, the outright most of any players for Morocco.
INSIGHTS	0'	Aged 18 years and 123 days, Spain's Gavi is the youngest player to start a knockout stage game at the World Cup since Brazil's Pelé in the 1958 final (17y 249d).
INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	This will be the second World Cup meeting between Morocco and Spain – in the first, in the 2018 group stages, Morocco twice took the lead before drawing 2-2, with Iago Aspas scoring a last minute Spain equaliser.	2	Spain have never lost in three previous meetings with Morocco (W2 D1), with their two wins both coming in qualifying play-off legs for the 1962 World Cup in November 1961 (1-0 away, 3-2 home).	3	Spain were eliminated at the round of 16 stage in the 2018 World Cup, losing to the hosts Russia on penalties after a 1-1 draw. The last time they progressed from this stage was in 2010, going on to win the tournament that year.	4	Morocco are featuring in the knockout stages of the World Cup for only the second time, also reaching the round of 16 in 1986, losing 1-0 to Germany that year.	5	Spain are set to face an African side in a World Cup knockout match for the first time, having played African teams five times before in the group stages (W3 D1 L1). The only one of those to beat the Spaniards were Nigeria in 1998, a 3-2 victory, a match that current manager Luis Enrique started for Spain.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	As for Spain, Enrique makes five alterations to the side that lost to Japan. In the defence, Rodri is the only one to retain his place, with Llorente coming in for Azpilicueta at right-back, Laporte replacing Torres at centre-back, and Alba starting ahead of Balde at left-back. The midfield trio of Gavi, Busquets and Pedri remains the same, with the other two changes coming in the attack. Williams drops to the bench and is replaced by Torres on the right wing, with Asensio leading the attack instead of Morata.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Morocco make one change to the team that beat Canada last time out. It comes in the midfield, with Amallah replacing Sabiri. En-Nesyri leads the attack and will be looking to become the first ever Morocco player to score three goals at the World Cup, with the Sevilla striker level with Salaheddine Bassir, Abdeljalil Hadda and Abderrazad Khairi on two goals.
