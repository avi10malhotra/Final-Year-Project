INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	Qatar have become the first host nation to lose two matches in a single group round of an edition of the World Cup.	2	Senegal earned their first win of the 2022 World Cup, meaning they have now won exactly once in all three of their group stage participations at the finals (2002 v France, 2018 v Poland, 2022 v Qatar).	3	Senegal scored three goals in a single World Cup match for a second time, after a 3-3 draw with Uruguay in 2002. This was also the first time they won a World Cup match by a margin of more than one goal, in what was their 10th match at the finals.
COMMENTARY	Post Match	Senegal get their first win of the 2022 World Cup with a 3-1 victory over Qatar. Dia opened the scoring just before half-time when he took advantage of Khoukhi's slip to roll his shot past Barsham into the back of the net. Just three minutes after the break, Diedhiou doubled their lead with a glancing header from a corner. Qatar did grow into the game and got their first-ever World Cup goal when substitute Muntari thumped in a header, but Dieng wrapped it up late on with a first-time strike.
INSIGHTS	90+3'	This is just the second time Senegal have scored at least three goals in a World Cup game after a 3-3 draw with Uruguay in 2002, and the first time they've had three different scorers in a game at the tournament.

INSIGHTS	63'	Since detailed data collection from 1966, this is just the second game that both goalkeepers have created at least one chance in the same World Cup game (one each for Meshaal Barsham and Édouard Mendy) after a 1986 game between Paraguay (one for Gato Fernández) and Belgium (one for Jean-Marie Pfaff).
COMMENTARY	63'	SAVE! Qatar have their first shot on target of the World Cup! The hosts move it nicely upfield again and Afif squares it into Ali. He turns to get it out of his feet before drilling a shot towards the near bottom corner, but Edouard Mendy tips it wide.

COMMENTARY	Half-time	Dia's goal gives Senegal a 1-0 lead over Qatar at half-time. Senegal have been on top since the first whistle but couldn't find a way through until the 41st minute. Khoukhi lost his footing as he tried to clear the ball and Dia made him pay for it by coolly rolling the ball past Barsham. Gueye came close and Diatta saw a shot pushed away as well, while Qatar haven't tested Edouard Mendy at the other end.

COMMENTARY	45'	Miguel crashed into Mohammad, who was jumping to bring the ball down, and he's hurt himself. He stays down holding his midriff, but he's okay to carry on after treatment.
INSIGHTS	41'	Senegal's Boulaye Dia has scored their first World Cup goal since Moussa Wague did so against Japan in 2018. It's their 32nd shot in the competition since then.
GOOOAAALLL!!!	41'	Qatar	0	-	1	Senegal	Boulaye Dia	Senegal · Striker #9	DIA SCORES! And it's a moment to forget for Khoukhi! Diatta swings a cross in from the left and Khoukhi loses his footing as he tries to clear his lines. The ball bounces up off his hip and drops kindly for Dia, who rolls it past Barsham to put Senegal 1-0 up!
INSIGHTS	30+3'	Senegal have never lost a World Cup match when scoring first (W2 D2).

YELLOW CARD	30'	Boulaye Dia	Senegal · Striker #9	Dia clips Ahmed's heels with a late challenge and goes into the referee's book for it.
INSIGHTS	28'	Qatar have already had as many touches in the opposition's box (2) as they did in the entirety of their World Cup opener against Ecuador (also 2).
COMMENTARY	28'	CLOSE! It's a poor clearing header from Khoukhi and Sarr is able to clip it into the far post with his second attempt. Sabaly puts the pressure on Barsham, who fumbles it before the right-back fires it past the post, but the flag goes up against him.
COMMENTARY	24'	WIDE! It's good build-up from Senegal and Dia cushions it down for Gueye on the edge of the D. He keeps the shot low, fizzing it across goal and it nicks the outside of the post on its way past.
YELLOW CARD	20'	Ismail Mohamad	Qatar · Defender #17	It's a poor challenge from Mohammad as he slides in on Nampalys Mendy from behind. He gets the ball but takes out the player, and it earns him the first booking of the game.
COMMENTARY	19'	There was a clash of heads during that corner, with Diallo and Miguel staying down and in need of treatment. They're both quickly back to their feet, though, and will be able to carry on.
COMMENTARY	16'	SAVE! Senegal move it quickly upfield, looking to Diatta down the left once more. He gets a yard on Mohammad as he cuts inside and fires a shot towards the near post, but Barsham pushes it wide.
COMMENTARY	10'	CHANCE! Sabaly makes a good run down the right before pulling it back to Dia in the middle. He spins away from Khoukhi, but it rolls to Nampalys Mendy. He hits the shot first time, but fires it wide of the far post.
INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	This will be the first meeting of any kind between Qatar and Senegal, while it’s also the first time Senegal are ever facing the host nation in a FIFA World Cup match.	2	Senegal’s only previous meeting with AFC opposition at the FIFA World Cup came in the last tournament in Russia, with the Lions twice letting a lead slip in a 2-2 draw with Japan.	3	Asian nations won two of their three World Cup matches against African sides in the 2018 World Cup (D1), having lost two of their three such games in the 2014 edition (D1).	4	Against Ecuador, Qatar became the first host nation to lose their opening match at that edition of the FIFA World Cup. Only four host countries have ever lost back-to-back matches at the tournament – Spain in 1982, USA in 1994, Korea Republic in 2002 and Brazil in 2014.	5	Qatar didn’t have a single shot on target in their opening match against Ecuador – the first host nation to fail to do so in a World Cup match since USA against Brazil in the round of 16 in 1994.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Aliou Cisse makes just two changes to the side that started against Netherlands on Monday, bringing in Jakobs and Diedhiou. Diallo is also fit enough to start after going off in that game with muscle cramps. Pape Cisse starts on the bench, while Cheikhou Kouyate is out with a muscle problem.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Felix Sanchez makes three changes from the game against Ecuador last time out. Barsham starts in goal, with Mohammad and Madibo also coming in. Al Sheeb and Hatem drop to the bench, while Bassam Al Rawi isn't in the squad.
