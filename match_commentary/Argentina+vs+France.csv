INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	Argentina have won the World Cup for a third time (also 1978 and 1986), 36 years since their last triumph in 1986. Only Italy (44 years from 1938 to 1982) have ever had a longer gap between winning two World Cups.	2	Each of the last three reigning champions to reach the World Cup final failed to win that final, with France joining Argentina in 1990 and Brazil in 1998 in doing so.	3	Argentina have won more penalty shootouts than any nation in World Cup history, with this their sixth such triumph. They are the third nation to win a World Cup final shootout, after Brazil in 1994 and Italy in 2006.
COMMENTARY	Post Match	ARGENTINA WIN THE WORLD CUP! It took penalties after an electric 3-3 draw, but Argentina win 4-2 in the shootout! Messi and Di Maria scored the first-half goals for Argentina before Mbappe's late brace took it to extra time. Messi thought he'd won it, but Mbappe penned them back again, getting his hat-trick from the spot. In the shootout, Martinez made a huge save before Tchouameni missed. Argentina scored all of theirs, with Montiel scoring the winner.

COMMENTARY	Half-time	Argentina take a 2-0 lead over France into half-time of the World Cup final. They were the better side in the first half, keeping the defending champions under pressure early on.

GOOOAAALLL!!!	36'	Argentina	2	-	0	France	Ángel Di María	Argentina · Striker #11	Asst: A. Mac Allister	DI MARIA SCORES!

Lloris rushes out, but the winger's first-time shot beats him and nestles into the far bottom corner. 2-0 Argentina!
INSIGHTS	32'	Excluding 0-0 draws (1994 edition), the team that scored first has gone on to lift the trophy in nine of the last 10 World Cup finals - the only exception was in 2006, when France went 1-0 up with a penalty from Zinedine Zidane before losing that final via a shootout.

The keeper dives to his right and can only watch as the ball flies into the opposite corner. 1-0 Argentina!
COMMENTARY	21'	PENALTY TO ARGENTINA! It's a great switch by Alvarez out to Di Maria on the left, and he checks back from the byline to catch out Dembele. The Frenchman chases him and nudges him from behind inside the box, and the referee points straight to the spot.

INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	Argentina are competing in their sixth World Cup final, with only Germany (8) participating in more. They're looking to win the trophy for a third time along with 1978 and 1986, but defeat would see them with the joint-most World Cup final losses in history (4, level with Germany).	2	France have reached the World Cup final for a fourth time, all since 1998 (1998, 2006, 2018, 2022). This is twice as many as any other nation in this period. Les Bleus, the reigning champions, are looking to become only the third nation to win back-to-back World Cups, after Italy (1934 and 1938) and Brazil (1958 and 1962).	3	This will be the fourth World Cup meeting between Argentina and France. La Albiceleste won two of the previous three, but lost the only such encounter in the knockout stage, a 3-4 defeat in 2018’s round of 16. Overall, this will be the 13th meeting between Argentina and France in all competitions, with Les Bleus winning just three of the previous 12 (D3 L6), although the most recent was their 4-3 win at the 2018 World Cup.	4	France are unbeaten in their last 10 World Cup matches against South American nations (W6 D4). Indeed, their last such defeat came against Argentina, doing down 2-1 in the 1978 first group stage.	5	This will be the 11th World Cup final competed between a South American and European nation; South American sides lifted the trophy on seven of those previous 10 occasions. However, Argentina are responsible for two of the three such defeats for South American teams (against Germany in 1990 and 2014), while France are responsible for the other win (3-0 v Brazil in 1998).
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Didier Deschamps is looking to become only the second manager to win two separate World Cups, and he makes two changes to the side that beat Morocco on Wednesday. Upamecano and Rabiot have both recovered from illness to get back into the team, while Varane is also well enough to retain his spot. Fofana and Konate start on the bench.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Lionel Scaloni makes just one change from their semi-final win over Croatia, and it's an attacking one as Di Maria is fit enough to start, so he replaces Paredes, who drops to the bench. Messi's final World Cup appearance is his 26th, and it's a record-breaking one as he becomes the all-time record holder for games played at the tournament. Acuna and Montiel are back on the bench after suspension.
