What a turnaround, what a story, and what a finish, to put Japan 2-1 up!!!

COMMENTARY	47'	WIDE!!! Germany race towards goal as Muller drives up the field. He finds Gnabry wide to his right, who blasts a powerful effort wide of the target!

COMMENTARY	Half-time	The first half ends, and what a half it's been! Germany almost suffered an early scare as Maeda tapped in after just eight minutes, but his offside position gave the 2014 champions a huge let-off. This spooked them into gear, and the remainder of the half was dominated by the Germans, who peppered the Japan goal before winning a 33rd-minute penalty. Gundogan slotted it home to put Die Nationalelf into a deserved lead. They almost doubled it before half-time, as Havertz finished off a great attacking move, but he was also caught in an offside position, meaning the lead is still just one goal at the break.
COMMENTARY	45+6'	WIDE!!! Japan go close in response, as Nagatomo's cross is met by Maeda in the box. His glancing header arcs towards the bottom corner, but skews wide of the post in a huge let-off for Germany!
COMMENTARY	45+5'	NO GOAL!! Replays show that Havertz was indeed offside as he tapped the ball home, meaning the goal will not count and Japan avoid going two goals behind!
NO GOAL	45+5'	No goal! After a VAR review, a goal for Germany is ruled out.
COMMENTARY	45+4'	BALL IN THE NET!!! Germany think they've doubled their lead following a brilliant passage of play, but there looks to be an issue of offside as Havertz wheels away! Muller's cross from the right is headed away to Kimmich, who hits a low shot towards the bottom corner. Gonda sees it late and parries it away, but Gnabry drills the ball back across the face and Havertz taps it in! The goal is given initially, but no doubt we'll be going upstairs for a second look...
COMMENTARY	45'	OVER!!! Musiala collects Kimmich's pass on the edge of the box and drops his shoulder to turn onto his right foot. He pulls the trigger from 17 yards, but fires his effort just over the crossbar!
COMMENTARY	42'	OVER!!! Germany fly forward at speed again as Musiala's square ball is met by Muller. He lays it off to Kimmich, but the Bayern Munich man can only send his shot over the crossbar!
GOOOAAALLL!!!	33'	Germany	1	-	0	Japan	İlkay Gündoğan	Germany · Midfielder #21	Penalty Goal	GOOOAAALLL!!! Germany lead!!! Gundogan finally has success in the box as he steps up to take the penalty, sends Gonda the wrong way, and slots the ball into the left-hand corner to put Germany 1-0 up! A needless penalty to concede from Japan's point of view, and after a bright start, the Samurai Blues trail!
COMMENTARY	31'	PENALTY TO GERMANY!!! Sakai is caught well out of position as Kimmich floats the ball over the top of him, to Raum. The left-back cuts onto his right foot, but is taken down by Gonda, with Japan goalkeeper is penalised for his attempted tackle and the referee points to the spot!
COMMENTARY	29'	BLOCKED!!! Gundogan finds Raum running down the left, and his cross from the byline is beaten away by Gonda. The loose ball falls to Gundogan, whose shot on the half-volley is blocked away by a flying Yoshida!
COMMENTARY	28'	SAVED!!! Really good play from Germany as Gnabry dummies to Muller down the right. Gnabry runs in-field and gets the ball back before teeing up Gundogan, who shoots first-time into the gloves of Gonda!
COMMENTARY	25'	A quick VAR check looks at a potential handball against Endo in the box, but there's no clear connection between the Japan midfielder and the ball from Havertz's cut-back.
COMMENTARY	20'	SAVED!!! Raum's inside ball is flicked back by Gundogan for Musiala. He's tackled, but Kimmich smashes the loose ball goalwards, drawing a decent parry from Gonda before Gundogan fires the rebound over the bar!
INSIGHTS	18'	Five of Ilkay Gündogan’s last six goals for Germany have come via the penalty spot.
INSIGHTS	18'	Yuto Nagatomo is the first Japanese player to play in four different World Cup tournaments, while he is also now the player with the most appearances for Japan in the tournament (12), surpassing Makoto Hasebe and Eiji Kawashima (both 11).
COMMENTARY	16'	WIDE!!! After Havertz wins a Germany corner, the ball is floated to the back post by Kimmich. Rudiger rises and gets his head to it, sending his effort into the side netting!
INSIGHTS	15'	Japan have yet to have a shot in this game – they’ve never previously failed to record a shot in the first half of a World Cup game.
COMMENTARY	8'	BALL IN THE NET!!! Gundogan loses the ball in midfield and Japan flood forward. It's spread right to Ito down the right, whose pinpoint cross is slotted home by Maeda at the far post! The flag's up though, with Maeda a good yard offside, and replays show that he really didn't need to make his move so early!
INSIGHTS	3'	Ilkay Gundogan is the first Germany player with five shots in the first half of a World Cup game since Miroslav Klose vs Ecuador in 2006, while the last German player with more such shots was Jurgen Klinsmann vs UAE in 1990 (6).
INSIGHTS	1'	Since the start of 2021 (calendar year), no player has scored more goals for Germany than Ilkay Gündogan (9 – level with Timo Werner).
INSIGHTS	0'	With his appearance today, Manuel Neuer (36y 241d) is the oldest German player to make a World Cup appearance since Oliver Kahn in 2006 vs Portugal (37y 23d).
INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	Germany and Japan are meeting for the first time at the FIFA World Cup. Germany are unbeaten in their two previous encounters with Japan (W1 D1), both friendly internationals in 2004 (3-0) and 2006 (2-2). All seven goals in their two previous encounters were scored in the second half.	2	Germany have won the FIFA World Cup four times, the joint-most for a European nation (Italy also four). Among all nations, only Brazil have lifted the trophy on more occasions (5).	3	This will be Germany’s 20th FIFA World Cup appearance, becoming only the second team, after Brazil, to reach the 20-participations mark in the tournament. The last time they didn’t participate in a World Cup edition was in 1950 – since then, they have progressed past the first round in every edition except for 2018, when they finished bottom of their group.	4	Germany have reached the semi-finals in four of their five World Cup participations this century, the only exception being 2018. That’s more than any other nation in this time.	5	Hosts Qatar excepted, Germany were the first team to qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, doing so on 11th October 2021. Germany won nine of their 10 games in the European qualifiers (L1), with only England (39) netting more goals than the Germans (36, excluding play-offs).
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Japan’s top scorer in qualifying, Yuya Osako, is absent from the tournament through injury, so Celtic forward Daizen Maeda starts up front. Five of the Japanese XI play their club football in Germany, including captain Maya Yoshida, and forward Daichi Kamada, who has already scored 12 goals in just 22 games so far this season.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Ilkay Gundogan and Serge Gnabry top-scored in qualifying for Germany, netting five goals each, and both start in Die Mannschaft’s midfield against Japan. They’ll support Kai Havertz up front, with the Chelsea forward likely to play as a false nine.
