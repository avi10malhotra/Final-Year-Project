INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	Argentina are unbeaten in their last 11 meetings with Mexico in all competitions (W8 D3) since a 1-0 loss in the 2004 Copa América.	2	Mexico have lost all four of their World Cup games against Argentina - only Nigeria (5 vs Argentina) have played more World Cup matches against a specific nation while losing every time.	3	Argentina kept their first clean sheet in seven World Cup matches, since a goalless draw with Netherlands in the 2014 semi final (progressed to the final on penalties).
COMMENTARY	Post Match	It may not have been a memorable performance, but Argentina get the win they needed, beating Mexico 2-0 at the Lusail Stadium to keep their hopes of qualification alive. As is so often the case, Messi proved to be the difference after a first half in which his side failed to hit the target. His goal from 25 yards out midway through the second half sneaked into the bottom corner to give the Albiceleste the lead and he would turn provider 23 minutes later, setting Fernandez up for a wonderful second. Mexico were determined but lacked quality in the final third, with the result dropping them to the bottom of the section, while Argentina climb into second.

INSIGHTS	Half-time	Argentina (1) and Mexico (3) produced a combined total of four shots in the first half, the lowest combined total in a World Cup game since Netherlands v Argentina in 2014 (3).
COMMENTARY	Half-time	A hotly contested first half at the Lusail Stadium comes to a close with nothing to separate Argentina and Mexico. A lack of quality on the ball and evident nerves combined to limit chances at either end of the pitch, but there is no doubt all 22 players are keenly up for the battle. With 15 fouls committed but just one shot on target, both teams were unable to settle down and play with rhythm, with constant pressing in the midfield causing turnovers and cynical tackles.
INSIGHTS	45+7'	Andrés Guardado is just the sixth different player to feature at five different World Cups (2006, 2010, 2014, 2018 and 2022) and the third different Mexican to do so after Rafael Márquez and Antonio Carbajal.
COMMENTARY	45'	GREAT STOP! Vega steps up and hits an accurate free-kick up and over the wall but a leaping Emiliano Martinez makes the ball stick to his gloves!
YELLOW CARD	43'	Gonzalo Montiel	Argentina · Defender #4	Montiel leaves his foot in cynically and takes Gutierrez down. The full-back is shown a yellow card as Mexico are given a free-kick late in the half.
SUBSTITUTION	42'	IN	Erick Gutiérrez	Mexico · Midfielder #14	OUT	Andrés Guardado	Mexico · Midfielder #18	Guardado - who missed Mexico's first match due to a knock - is replaced with three minutes left in the half. Gutierrez comes on in his stead.
INSIGHTS	40'	Lautaro Martinez's effort was Argentina's first shot of the game, it's the latest they've recorded their first shot in a World Cup match since detailed data collection from 1966.
YELLOW CARD	22'	Néstor Araujo	Mexico · Defender #2	Araujo lunges into a tackle with his foot raised, catching Acuna on the ankle. It’s a yellow card for the defender - the first of the match.
COMMENTARY	11'	CHANCE! Vega is used as a decoy with Chavez putting a free-kick from the left wing into a dangerous area inside the 18-yard box. Herrera manages to get his studs to the ball but he puts it just wide of the far post!
INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	Argentina are unbeaten in their last 10 meetings with Mexico in all competitions (W7 D3) since a 1-0 loss in the 2004 Copa América.	2	Mexico have lost all three of their FIFA World Cup games against Argentina, going down 6-3 in 1930, 2-1 in 2006 and 3-1 in 2010. Only Austria (4 vs Italy) and Nigeria (5 vs Argentina) have faced an opponent more often in the competition while losing every time.	3	Argentina's defeat against Saudi Arabia on MD1 ended a run of 13 straight World Cup victories against non-European nations, since losing to Cameroon in 1990. They've never lost consecutive World Cup matches against non-European sides before.	4	Argentina have lost four of their last six World Cup matches (W1 D1), as many as they had in their previous 25 in the competition (W16 D5). They've lost their last two games at the tournament, only losing three in a row once before (between 1930 and 1958).	5	Following their 2-1 defeat against Saudi Arabia on MD1, Argentina are looking to avoid losing both of their first two games at a single edition of the World Cup for the first time in their history.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Mexico make three changes to the XI that earned a 0-0 draw with Poland. Araujo and Kevin Alvarez come in for Herrera and Edson Alvarez, while a change of shape allows Guardado to play ahead of Martin.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Argentina make five changes from their 2-1 loss to Saudi Arabia last time out. Only Otamendi keeps his place in defence with Montiel, Lisandro Martinez and Acuna replacing Molina, Romero and Tagliafico respectively. Guido Rodriguez starts ahead of Paredes in midfield and Mac Allister is in for Gomez.
