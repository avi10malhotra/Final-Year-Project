INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	Brazil have beaten Switzerland at the World Cup for the first time, with each of the previous two meetings ending level.	2	Switzerland failed to score in a game against Brazil for the first time since December 1980 (a 0-2 loss in a friendly) having scored exactly one goal in each of their previous six matches against them before today.	3	Brazil have become the first side in World Cup history to go unbeaten in 17 consecutive group stage matches (including final and second group rounds in earlier editions).
COMMENTARY	Post Match	It's all over, and Brazil sneak the victory in a game they were far from their best in to secure qualification to the last 16! Casemiro's thumping finish seven minutes from time grants them all three points, after an earlier goal by Vinicius was ruled out for an offside in the build-up. Switzerland did threaten going forward, but Brazil kept them at bay relatively easily, and eventually their quality in the final third told as Casemiro lashed in the winner. The Selecao are home and dry in the knockouts, while Switzerland have plenty to do in their final game against Serbia in order to join them.
INSIGHTS	90+6'	Nine of Brazil's last 10 World Cup goals have been scored in the second half.
INSIGHTS	90+6'	Alex Sandro is the first player to make seven tackles and win possession 11 times in a World Cup game since Daniele De Rossi in 2010 for Italy against Paraguay.
COMMENTARY	90+4'	BLOCKED!!! What a goal that would've been! A long pass from the back is flicked on by Vinicius, and Rodrygo looks to slot it home but Akanji gets in the way of it to prevent a certain goal!
COMMENTARY	90+3'	CHANCE!!! Jesus plays it forward for Vinicius, who strolls past Fernandes to give Brazil a two-on-one. He takes a poor touch as he reaches the box though, and Akanji wins possession back for the Swiss.
COMMENTARY	87'	SAVED!!! Jesus races towards the box from the left and puts Rodrygo into shooting space. He tries his luck, but his near-post effort is tipped over by Sommer!
INSIGHTS	86'	Brazil are still yet to face a shot on target at the World Cup so far. The last team to go through the first two games of a World Cup without facing a shot on target were France in 1998.
SUBSTITUTION	86'	IN	Alex Telles	Brazil · Defender #16	OUT	Alex Sandro	Brazil · Defender #6	Alex Sandro also comes off, and it's a like-for-like replacement for Brazil as fellow left-back Alex Telles comes on.
SUBSTITUTION	86'	IN	Fabian Frei	Switzerland · Midfielder #20	OUT	Silvan Widmer	Switzerland · Defender #3	Widmer is replaced in Switzerland's latest change, and Fabian Frei comes on as they begin to chase the game.
GOOOAAALLL!!!	83'	Brazil	1	-	0	Switzerland	Casemiro	Brazil · Midfielder #5	Asst: Rodrygo	GOOOOAAAALLL!!! Brazil have their breakthrough this time!!! Vinicius' inside pass is flicked on by Rodrygo, and the ball takes one bounce in the box before Casemiro smashes a half-volley that sends the ball spiralling into the far corner!! That's one hell of an improvised finish by the defensive midfielder, and it finally puts the Selecao 1-0 up!
SUBSTITUTION	76'	IN	Haris Seferovic	Switzerland · Striker #9	OUT	Breel Embolo	Switzerland · Striker #7	Embolo has been shut out convincingly up front, and Haris Seferovic replaces him for Switzerland.
SUBSTITUTION	76'	IN	Michel Aebischer	Switzerland · Midfielder #14	OUT	Djibril Sow	Switzerland · Midfielder #15	Switzerland make further changes, as Sow comes off for Michel Aebischer.
SUBSTITUTION	73'	IN	Antony	Brazil · Striker #19	OUT	Raphinha	Brazil · Striker #11	Raphinha's also been quiet so far this second half, and Antony will replace the Barcelona winger.
SUBSTITUTION	73'	IN	Gabriel Jesus	Brazil · Striker #18	OUT	Richarlison	Brazil · Striker #9	Richarlison's heroics against Serbia haven't been repeated in this game, and he won't play any further part as he's taken off for Gabriel Jesus.
COMMENTARY	66'	NO GOAL!!! Replays point out that Richarlison, who didn't touch the ball but was certainly active in the move, came back from an offside position, and so despite Vinicius timing his run to perfection, the goal will not stand!
NO GOAL	66'	No goal! After a VAR review, a goal for Brazil is ruled out.
COMMENTARY	64'	BALL IN THE NET!!! Brazil think they've broken the deadlock here! The Swiss defence is pulled out of position and Casemiro threads a pass forward for Vinicius. He steps over the sliding challenge of Widmer, and keeps his composure to coolly slot the ball beyond Sommer and into the bottom corner! The goal is initially given, but the referee's heard something in his ear here...
SUBSTITUTION	59'	IN	Renato Steffen	Switzerland · Striker #11	OUT	Fabian Rieder	Switzerland · Midfielder #25	Rieder has also looked good in spells down the opposite flank, and Renato Steffen will replace him for the Swiss.
SUBSTITUTION	59'	IN	Edimilson Fernandes	Switzerland · Midfielder #2	OUT	Ruben Vargas	Switzerland · Midfielder #17	Vargas has been one of Switzerland's best on that left-hand side, but comes off now for Edimilson Fernandes.
SUBSTITUTION	58'	IN	Bruno Guimarães	Brazil · Midfielder #17	OUT	Fred	Brazil · Midfielder #8	Fred is off in Brazil's next change, and Newcastle United's Bruno Guimaraes will replace him in the middle.
COMMENTARY	57'	CHANCE!!! Fred threads a pass through to Vinicius, who flashes the ball across the face of goal with the outside of his boot. Richarlison dives to connect at the far post, but is inches away from tapping the ball home as it flies wide!
COMMENTARY	53'	CHANCE!! Widmer surges into the box to latch onto a cross-field pass from the left, and he drills a low ball towards the near post. Rieder slides in but can't connect properly, while Sow's rebound is blocked by Sandro!
YELLOW CARD	52'	Fred	Brazil · Midfielder #8	Raphinha's cross into the middle is cut out and Switzerland look to break, but Sow is clipped from behind by Fred, who receives the game's second booking in as many minutes.
YELLOW CARD	50'	Fabian Rieder	Switzerland · Midfielder #25	Rodrygo attempts to turn away from Rieder, but is caught in the face by a stray elbow from the Swiss winger and falls into Freuler. Rieder is booked as a result, as Rodrygo eventually gets to his feet.
SUBSTITUTION	46'	IN	Rodrygo	Brazil · Striker #21	OUT	Lucas Paquetá	Brazil · Midfielder #7	Brazil make an attacking half-time change, with Real Madrid winger Rodrygo coming on for Lucas Paqueta.
INSIGHTS	Half-time	Switzerland had just one attempt in the first half, their lowest tally in the opening 45 minutes of a World Cup game since their opening game in 2010 against Spain (also 1).
INSIGHTS	Half-time	Switzerland had just one attempt in the first half, their lowest tally in the opening 45 minutes since their opening game in 2010 against Spain (also 1).
COMMENTARY	Half-time	We've got a stalemate so far, with both sides in this game still yet to really get going. Brazil have forced Sommer into some light work with shots from Vinicius and Raphinha, but Brazil's hero against Serbia, Richarlison, has been kept at arm's length so far. Switzerland have looked dangerous on the break at times, but are yet to test Alisson, and both sides need to improve in the final third if we're to see some goals in the second half!
COMMENTARY	44'	WIDE!!! Silva arrives at the front post to meet Raphinha's corner, but his goalward header is deflected away from the target by Elvedi!
COMMENTARY	39'	CHANCE!! Rodriguez's cross from the left is deflected into the path of Vargas, who beats Marquinhos with a superb Cruyff turn, but hesitates from shooting on the angle and is tackled by Silva!
COMMENTARY	31'	SAVED!! Raphinha plays a one-two with Militao as he drifts in-field. He picks the ball up centrally and shoots from 25 yards, sending a looping strike straight into the gloves of Sommer!
INSIGHTS	30'	Brazil have failed to have a shot in the opening 20 minutes for a second consecutive World Cup game. Before this, they'd only failed to do so in two of their previous 29 games in the competition.
COMMENTARY	27'	SAVED!!! Raphinha drops a shoulder before curling a good cross into the box. Vinicius peels off his marker and ghosts in at the far post, but his effort of the volley is parried behind well by Sommer!
COMMENTARY	19'	CHANCE! After great work from Vinicius engages four Swiss defenders, Paqueta peels down the left and crosses into the area. Richarlison stretches at the front post, but can't quite reach the ball and Elvedi clears!
COMMENTARY	12'	CHANCE! An absolute beauty of a flick pass forward from Paqueta puts Richarlison into open space, but the striker only has Vinicius to aim at in the box and the cut-back is intercepted by Elvedi!
INSIGHTS	0'	This is the latest into a World Cup game that Brazil have attempted their first shot (27th minute) since 1994 against Cameroon (32nd minute).
INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	Both previous meetings between Brazil and Switzerland at the FIFA World Cup have ended in a draw (2-2 in 1950, 1-1 in 2018). No side have Brazil faced more at the competition without ever winning than the Swiss (also two vs Portugal and Hungary).	2	Switzerland have won two of their last four meetings with Brazil in all competitions (D1 L1), having failed to win any of their first five (D3 L2). The Swiss have scored exactly once in each of their last six against Brazil.	3	Switzerland have won just one of their eight FIFA World Cup games against South American sides (D2 L5), beating Ecuador 2-1 in 2014 in Brasilia.	4	Brazil are unbeaten in their last 16 group stage games at the World Cup – no side has ever gone 17 without defeat in the group stages of the competition before (including final and second group rounds in earlier editions).	5	Following their 1-0 win over Cameroon on MD1, Switzerland are looking to win their opening two games at a World Cup for the first time. The last time they won consecutive games in the competition was in 2006 against Togo and Korea Republic.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Just one change for Switzerland, with 20-year-old winger Fabian Rieder coming in for Xerdan Shaqiri. He’ll be looking to supply Breel Embolo with plenty of ammunition up top, as the Monaco forward looks to add to the World Cup account he opened against Cameroon.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Brazil’s headline absentee is Neymar, who picked up a nasty ankle injury against Serbia and will miss the remainder of the group stage. His team-mates will be hoping to get the job of qualifying for the knockouts done in his absence. The Selecao are also missing Danilo at right-back, with Eder Militao and Fred coming in for him and Neymar respectively.
