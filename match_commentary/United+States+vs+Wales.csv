INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	Two of the three meetings between USA and Wales in all competitions have finished level, with USA winning the other 2-0 back in 2003.	2	USA have won their opening game at just three of the 11 World Cup tournaments they’ve appeared in (D3 L5).	3	Wales (D2 L4) have gone six games without a victory in all competitions for the first time since September 2010 - May 2011 (six successive losses).
COMMENTARY	Post Match	A typical game of two halves ends in a 1-1 draw, after the US dominated the first half with a livewire display and Wales fought back via a more direct approach after the interval. Both teams take a point from their opening Group B fixture, but given the circumstances, Wales will be more pleased with salvaging something from an encounter they simply couldn't get a foothold in during the first 45. Once again, Bale is the Welsh saviour as the Dragons roar back late on.
YELLOW CARD	90+10'	Kellyn Acosta	USA · Midfielder #23	For the second time today, Bale is hauled over by an American defender in a cynical manner. Acosta brings down his club-mate by the halfway line and receives a deserved booking.
SUBSTITUTION	90+5'	IN	Joe Morrell	Wales · Midfielder #16	OUT	Ethan Ampadu	Wales · Midfielder #15	Morrell is thrown on for the closing stages; a limping Ampadu makes his way to the touchline. It seems the latter has been afflicted by cramp.
SUBSTITUTION	90+3'	IN	Sorba Thomas	Wales · Midfielder #22	OUT	Harry Wilson	Wales · Midfielder #8	Having failed to fully recover from his injury, Wilson is replaced by Thomas for the final few minutes of the game.
SUBSTITUTION	88'	IN	Jordan Morris	USA · Striker #16	OUT	Timothy Weah	USA · Striker #21	A final roll of the dice by Berhalter sees Morris replace opening goalscorer Weah up front.
INSIGHTS	84+3'	USA haven't kept a clean sheet in any of their last 18 World Cup games against European nations, since beating England 1-0 in 1950
INSIGHTS	82'	Gareth Bale's penalty was the first goal that Wales have scored against the USA (in all competitions)
INSIGHTS	82'	Gareth Bale is just the fourth player to score a World Cup goal for Wales, after John Charles, Ivor Allchurch and Terry Medwin (all in 1958)
GOOOAAALLL!!!	82'	USA	1	-	1	Wales	Gareth Bale	Wales · Striker #11	Penalty Goal	WALES EQUALISE!!! Bale bails Cymru out again! After winning the penalty himself, Wales' veteran skipper steps up to handle the pressure and drives his spot-kick into the top of the net via fingertip from Turner. It was a brave effort to keep the ball out, but Bale applied too much power! It's 1-1!
COMMENTARY	81'	PENALTY!! An awful sliding tackle from Zimmerman inside the American area upends Bale, and the referee does not hesitate in pointing to the spot! Wales have a golden chance to equalise!
SUBSTITUTION	79'	IN	Brennan Johnson	Wales · Striker #9	OUT	Neco Williams	Wales · Midfielder #3	A break in play while Weah is down injured allows Wales to make another substitution: full-back Williams is replaced by a forward, Johnson.
SUBSTITUTION	75'	IN	Kellyn Acosta	USA · Midfielder #23	OUT	Yunus Musah	USA · Midfielder #6	A third US change, and their fourth overall, sees Musah replaced by Acosta in midfield.
SUBSTITUTION	74'	IN	DeAndre Yedlin	USA · Defender #22	OUT	Sergiño Dest	USA · Defender #2	Another player to have received a yellow card during the first half is withdrawn by Berhalter: Dest is replaced by the experienced Yedlin at right-back.
SUBSTITUTION	74'	IN	Haji Wright	USA · Striker #19	OUT	Josh Sargent	USA · Striker #24	Far quieter in the second half, Sargent comes off too. Wright is introduced up front.
SUBSTITUTION	66'	IN	Brenden Aaronson	USA · Midfielder #11	OUT	Weston McKennie	USA · Midfielder #8	Booked during the first half, McKennie is replaced by Aaronson in the USA midfield.
COMMENTARY	65'	CLOSE! Now, Moore almost hauls Wales level, as his header following a corner slung across from the right glances just over the crossbar! Another close call for the US, who are now entirely on the back foot.
INSIGHTS	64'	Wales had their first shot on target in the 64th minute of this match.
COMMENTARY	64'	SAVE! Zimmerman and Adams both fail to fully clear Wilson's cross from a free-kick on the right, then the ball pops up to Bale, who nods on for Davies in the box. The defender's headed effort forces Turner into a smart reaction save, as he tips the ball over crossbar.
YELLOW CARD	51'	Tim Ream	USA · Defender #13	As Bale threatens to sprint clear from the halfway line, Ream tugs the Wales captain back and then accepts his consequent booking.
INSIGHTS	48'	Wales have already had more shots in the opening 20 minutes of the 2nd half than they did in the whole of the first
SUBSTITUTION	46'	IN	Kieffer Moore	Wales · Striker #13	OUT	Daniel James	Wales · Striker #20	Not surprisingly, Page has opted to make a half-time change: James' departure for Moore signals a more direct approach in the second half.
COMMENTARY	Half-time	A performance of great verve and enterprise from a youthful US team earns them a merited half-time lead in their opening World Cup fixture. Dominant in all aspects, Berhalter's boys have passed crisply and closed Wales down feverishly; suggesting they could be a nation to watch at this finals. Increasingly influential as the half wore on, Pulisic was the man to unlock the door nearing the interval, as his turn and pass played in Weah to score the game's only goal.
YELLOW CARD	45+3'	Chris Mepham	Wales · Defender #5	Rather desperately, Mepham twice grabs a handful of Pulisic's shirt and pulls the US forward back. That results in another booking - the fourth of this half.
YELLOW CARD	40'	Gareth Bale	Wales · Striker #11	For a clear foul on Musah in midfield, Bale is shown a yellow card by the referee - that's Wales' first booking today.
INSIGHTS	37'	Christian Pulisic is the 15th different player to provide an assist for the USA at the World Cup
INSIGHTS	36'	Timothy Weah has scored two goals in his last four games for USA in all competitions, as many as in his first 22 for the national side
GOOOAAALLL!!!	36'	USA	1	-	0	Wales	Timothy Weah	USA · Striker #21	Asst: C. Pulisic	USA LEAD! It's been coming! Sargent and Pulisic combine quickly just inside the Wales half, and the latter loses little time in spotting space to thread a low ball through to Weah. The US striker latches onto the ball with glee just outside the box, and takes just one strides before sliding the ball home past Hennessey to open the scoring! USA 1-0 WALES!
YELLOW CARD	13'	Weston McKennie	USA · Midfielder #8	Again, Williams is felled - this time by McKennie's aggressive tackle from behind - and another booking ensues for the US.
YELLOW CARD	11'	Sergiño Dest	USA · Defender #2	An over-zealous challenge from Dest on Williams by the touchline results in the game's first booking.
INSIGHTS	10'	USA have never had a goalless draw at the World Cup in 34 matches (more than any other team in the history of the competition)
COMMENTARY	9'	SAVE! OFF THE POST!! Hennessey makes a crucial save, as Weah whips a ball across to the centre of the six-yard box and Rodon almost turns the ball beyond his own goalkeeper from close range! Following his reflex stop, Sargent follows up and strikes the outside of the post with a low shot from the right!! What an escape for Wales!
INSIGHTS	4'	Timothy Weah is the first player to score a World Cup goal against Wales since Pele in 1958
INSIGHTS	0'	There has been just one shot from inside the box so far, and none since the 10th minute
INSIGHTS	0'	Five USA starters play in the Premier League, the most of any non-American league in a match in the USA's World Cup history.
INSIGHTS	0'	USA are starting with their youngest starting XI (25y 100d) in a World Cup game since a 1-2 loss to Austria in June 1990 (24y 52d).
INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	This is the first meeting between USA and Wales at the FIFA World Cup. The US team are so far unbeaten in their two previous encounters (W1 D1), both friendlies.	2	USA have qualified for their 11th FIFA World Cup, and first since the 2014 edition, when they were eventually eliminated by Belgium in the round of 16.	3	Including 2022, only Mexico (17) have appeared in more FIFA World Cups than USA (11) among CONCACAF nations, while USA have reached the knockout stage in three of their last four participations (2002, 2010, 2014).	4	USA have only kept two clean sheets in their last 27 matches at the FIFA World Cup, conceding 46 goals in the process. In contrast, USA had kept a clean sheet in three of their first six World Cup matches between 1930 and 1950.	5	In 33 games at the FIFA World Cup, the USA have never registered a goalless draw. That’s more than any other team in the history of the competition.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	The big news for Wales is that captain Bale will be fit to start in the Middle East. The ex-Real Madrid forward will be flanked by James and Wilson, with Page opting for a three-man defence that includes Tottenham's Davies.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	USA have named their youngest starting XI (25y 100d) in a World Cup game since a 2-1 loss to Austria in June 1990 (24y 52d). Gregg Berhalter's side will start with a front three including Chelsea's Pulisic, while Milan loanee Dest and Juventus' McKennie make up an experienced team that belies their youthful age.
