INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	Australia have won consecutive World Cup matches for the first time, while progressing from the group stages of the competition for just the second time in six tournament appearances (also 2006).	2	Denmark have been eliminated at the group stages of the World Cup for just the second time (also 2010), while this is the first time they've lost consecutive group stage games at the tournament.	3	Australia are the third team to progress from the first round group stage of the World Cup having both lost and conceded 4+ goals in their opening match of the tournament, after Yugoslavia in 1990 and Ukraine in 2006.
COMMENTARY	Post Match	The first half was largely controlled by Denmark but still fairly quiet in both boxes. Ryan was forced into a stop after Souttar turned Maehle’s cross toward his own goal, but the goalkeeper reacted well to save with his feet. Australia did manage three shots on target in the first period, but all the attempts were tame and comfortable for Schmeichel to save. Australia started the second period well and were rewarded as Leckie put them in the lead in the 60th minute. He ran 40 yards before nutmegging Maehle on his on way to finding the bottom right corner. Denmark were poor in the second half and could not trouble Ryan at all as Australia win 1-0 to progress to the knockout rounds.
