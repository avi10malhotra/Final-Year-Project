INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	Canada became the first side since Denmark against Brazil in 1998 to lose a match at the World Cup having scored inside two minutes in that game. The last team to lose despite scoring earlier than Canada today was France against Italy in 1978 (29 seconds).	2	Croatia have avoided defeat in four of the last five World Cup games in which they conceded the first goal (W2 D2), with all five games coming since the start of the 2018 edition.	3	Canada have lost all five of their World Cup matches to date – only El Salvador (6) have played more games in the competition while losing on each occasion.
COMMENTARY	Post Match	Canada’s first-ever lead in a World Cup came just 120 seconds into the match but it wasn’t enough to keep their hopes alive as Croatia come back to win 4-1 at the Khalifa International Stadium. Davies gave the Canucks their first-ever goal at a World Cup finals, but the advantage lasted just over a half-hour, before Kramaric pulled Dalic’s men back level with an accurate strike. Livaja’s finish a minute before injury time gave the 2018 finalists a 2-1 lead at the half, more or less confirming the result. To their credit, Canada remained positive and looked for a result until the end but confusion at the back would cost them two more after the interval with Perisic linking up with Kramaric for the second time in the game after 70 minutes, before a late Majer tap-in put the finishing touches on the win. The three points give Dalic’s side a chance to finish the group on top, while Canada are eliminated.

COMMENTARY	Half-time	An entertaining and unpredictable first half at the Khalifa International Stadium comes to a close with Croatia ahead of Canada by two goals to one, overcoming an early deficit to lead after 45 minutes. It was a perfect start for Herdman’s side, who dealt with much frustration against Belgium to score just 120 seconds into the game, after Buchanan’s cross was met by the rising Davies. The Canucks lost their discipline as time wore on though, allowing Modric and Kovacic to link up with speed to exploit the spaces ahead of the penalty area, much to Kramaric and Livaja’s delight.
INSIGHTS	44'	Marko Livaja has scored two goals in his last three appearances for Croatia, as many as he’d scored in his first 13 games for his country.
GOOOAAALLL!!!	44'	Croatia	2	-	1	Canada	Marko Livaja	Croatia · Striker #14	Asst: J. Juranović	CROATIA TAKE THE LEAD! 2-1! A lovely incisive run by Juranovic gets Croatia up the pitch near Canada’s penalty area, where Miller puts in a sliding challenge. The ball bobbles and comes back to the attacking full-back, who splits the legs of the defender with a pass to Livaja. From there, the striker takes a touch to set himself before beating Borjan coolly!
INSIGHTS	40'	Andrej Kramaric has scored his second World Cup goal, also scoring vs Russia in 2018.
INSIGHTS	36'	Alphonso Davies has scored his 13th international goal for Canada but today’s goal was the first to be scored with his head.
GOOOAAALLL!!!	36'	Croatia	1	-	1	Canada	Andrej Kramarić	Croatia · Striker #9	Asst: I. Perišić	CROATIA PULL LEVEL! 1-1! A quick bit of passing from Dalic’s side opens up a pocket of space for Perisic on the left corner of the penalty area. He plays a smart disguised pass into the box for Kramaric, who dispatches his finish with confidence!
COMMENTARY	35'	GREAT SAVE! Kovacic threads a lovely pass into Livaja, who gets a half-step on Miller before firing a shot that’s turned behind expertly by Borjan!
COMMENTARY	26'	CROATIA SCORE BUT IT WON’T COUNT! Kramaric gets into the penalty area and beats both Laryea and Miller before slotting a shot high into the roof of the goal from an acute angle, but Livaja’s inability to stay onside in the build-up means it remains 1-0 to the Canucks.
INSIGHTS	8'	Correction: Alphonso Davies’ strike after 1:08 was the quickest goal scored at the World Cup since Zanka (Denmark) vs Croatia in 2018 (57 secs).
INSIGHTS	4'	Ivan Perišić has been directly involved in more goals than any other player for Croatia in major tournament history (15 - 9 goals + 6 assists in World Cup + Euro).
GOOOAAALLL!!!	2'	Croatia	0	-	1	Canada	Alphonso Davies	Canada · Midfielder #19	Asst: T. Buchanan	CANADA’S FIRST GOAL AT THE WORLD CUP! WHO ELSE BUT DAVIES? 1-0! Buchanan whips a lovely cross into the penalty area between Lovren and Juranovic, with Davies storming in to meet it. The wing-back rises highest and powers a header past Livakovic to give his side the lead within 120 seconds!
INSIGHTS	1'	Alphonso Davies has scored Canada’s first ever goal at the World Cup in what is their fifth match.
INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	This will be the first ever meeting between Croatia and Canada.	2	Croatia have faced CONCACAF sides on three previous occasions at the World Cup – they beat Jamaica 3-1 in their first ever match in the competition in 1998, before losing to Mexico in both 2002 and 2014.	3	Canada have lost all four of their World Cup matches without scoring a single goal. This is the most games any nation has played without ever scoring in the competition, while only El Salvador (six games) have played more matches at the finals without ever avoiding defeat.	4	Croatia's goalless draw with Morocco on MD1 ended their run of scoring in 11 consecutive World Cup matches. Only once have they failed to score in consecutive games at the same edition of the tournament, doing so in their first two group games in 2006.	5	Canada attempted 22 shots in their defeat to Belgium on MD1, twice as many as their previous record in a World Cup match (11 v USSR in 1986). However, just three of those efforts were on target (14%).
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Canada also make just one change to the side that lost 1-0 to Belgium on Wednesday, with Club Brugge’s Larin selected ahead of Hoilett.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Croatia make a single change to the XI that drew 0-0 with Morocco last time out, with Livaja replacing Vlasic on the right wing.
