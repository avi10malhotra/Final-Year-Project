INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	Belgium have failed to progress to the knockout stages of a World Cup tournament for the first time since 1998.	2	After failing to reach the knockout stages in three consecutive participations (2002, 2006, 2014), Croatia have now progressed from their group at consecutive editions (2018, 2022).	3	Belgium scored one goal at this World Cup – in 19 previous participations at major tournaments (World Cup + Euros), they have only scored fewer goals once (1930 World Cup – 0).
COMMENTARY	Post Match	Croatia advance to the World Cup round of 16 at the expense of Belgium after playing out a goalless draw in their Group F clash. Neither team could force a breakthough, but Romelu Lukaku missed four great openings that could have saved the Red Devils from a premature exit from the competition. Lukaku struck the post and missed from close range on a frustrating night for the forward after he was introduced at half-time. Croatia held firm at the back to secure the goalless draw to advance in second place ahead of Belgium, while Morocco finish top of Group F as a result of their win over Canada.

Lovren takes it away from Livakovic with a glancing header that travels straight onto the head of Lukaku, but he plants his header over the bar. A shocking miss, although replays show that the ball may have been out before De Bruyne put his delivery into the box.

COMMENTARY	51'	OVER! De Bruyne twists and turns in the box and shoots on his left foot, but he scuffs his attempt wide of the target. It's much better from Belgium, but they need to be clinical.

INSIGHTS	Half-time	This game is the second of this World Cup to see no shots on target in the first half, after Japan v Costa Rica
COMMENTARY	Half-time	It it goalless at the break between Croatia and Belgium in their World Cup Group F clash. As it stands, Belgium are heading out of the tournament due to Morocco's advantage over Canada at the break. It could have been a worse situation for the Red Devils when Croatia were awarded a penalty, which was then overturned by a debatable offside call from VAR. The two sides have been restricted to efforts from distance, although Dries Mertens missed the best chance of the game, curling his strike over the bar. It is all to play for in the second half in a straight shootout between the two teams for a place in the knockout phase.
COMMENTARY	18'	VAR! NO PENALTY! The referee overturns the decision for offside as Lovren moved a fraction too early from Modric's free-kick in the build-up to the foul from Carrasco. The Atletico Madrid man can breathe a huge sigh of relief.
NO PENALTY	17'	No penalty! After a VAR review, a penalty awarded to Croatia is overturned.
COMMENTARY	15'	PENALTY TO CROATIA! After a scramble in the box, Carrasco sticks out a leg and catches Kramaric with a late boot. Referee Anthony Taylor points straight to the spot.
COMMENTARY	13'	CHANCE! Mertens has to hit the target! De Bruyne leads a counter through the heart of the Croatia backline and he slides a throughball for Mertens in space. The forward connects first-time with his strike, but he steers it over the bar. A huge chance spurned.
COMMENTARY	10'	BLOCK! Carrasco cuts inside from the left flank and fires at goal on his right foot, but Brozovic is there to charge down his strike.
INSIGHTS	1'	Thibaut Courtois is making his 100th appearance for Belgium and becomes the first goalkeeper to reach this milestone for the men’s national side and seventh player overall after Jan Vertonghen, Axel Witsel, Toby Alderweireld, Eden Hazard, Dries Mertens and Romelu Lukaku.

INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	Belgium have won their last two meetings with Croatia in all competitions, with Romelu Lukaku netting all three of their goals across these victories.	2	This is the first FIFA World Cup meeting between Croatia and Belgium. Croatia have only lost two of their 10 meetings with fellow European nations in the competition (W6 D2), with both of those losses coming against France (1998 semi-final, 2018 final).	3	Croatia have scored more than once in just one of their eight meetings with Belgium in all competitions, winning 4-0 in March 2003 in a European Championships qualifier – they’ve scored just five goals across the other seven matches with the Red Devils.	4	Last time out, Croatia scored four goals in a single World Cup game for only the second time in their history, also doing so against Cameroon in 2014 (4-0). Croatia have won four of their last five group stage games at the World Cup (D1), as many as in their first 12 such games combined (W4 D2 L6).	5	Belgium’s 2-0 defeat to Morocco on matchday two ended a 13-game unbeaten run across World Cup group stage games (W8 D5), they last lost consecutive World Cup group games between 1982 and 1986 (three in a row).
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Belgium have made four changes to their side that was beaten by Morocco in their last outing. Dendoncker returns to the fold to start in a back three alongside Vertonghen and Alderweireld. Mertens, Trossard and Carrasco all come into the final third as Eden Hazard, Thorgan Hazard and Batshuayi make way. Amadou Onana misses out due to suspension.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Croatia are unchanged from their win over Canada last time out. Livaja and Kramaric continue to lead the line supported by Perisic in the final third. The midfield trio of Modric, Brozovic and Kovacic will look to control proceedings against De Bruyne and company.
