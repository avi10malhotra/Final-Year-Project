INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	15 of the 24 shots in this match between Denmark and Tunisia came via a corner situation – the most recorded in a single World Cup match since 1966.	2	There were 24 shots without a single goal between Denmark and Tunisia – the most shots recorded in a goalless draw at the World Cup since Netherlands versus Costa Rica in July 2014 (26 shots).	3	Tunisia recorded only their second clean sheet in 16 matches at the World Cup, with their other shutout coming against Germany in 1978 (0-0).
COMMENTARY	Post Match	Denmark were denied a late penalty in an entertaining goalless draw with Tunisia in the opening match of Group D. Deep into stoppage time, referee Cesar Arturo Ramos was instructed to go to the monitor after the ball hit the hand of Meriah, but he decided not to give a spot-kick. It would have been harsh on Tunisia, who had the better of the chances. In the first half, Jebali had a goal disallowed for offside before being denied by Schmeichel. One-on-one with the former Leicester man, Jebali’s close-range chip was tipped wide by the goalkeeper. After a difficult opening 45 minutes, Denmark grew into the game. Given the captaincy, after Kjaer was substituted, Eriksen had an effort pushed wide before substitute Cornelius had a glorious opportunity. The ball was headed towards him by Christensen but he hit the post with the goal gaping. Running towards it, he attempted to turn it in with his knee before using his head.

COMMENTARY	Half-time	The game is goalless at half-time, with Tunisia the better side in the opening 45 minutes. Kadri’s side have been on top of the opposition, with their energetic pressing style and defensive commitment deserving of a clean sheet at the very least. Drager saw a powerful effort deflected wide, with Laidouni missing the target, before Jebali had a golden chance. One-on-one with Schmeichel, his chipped effort was pushed over by the goalkeeper who made himself big to deny the striker.

INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	This is the first encounter between Denmark and Tunisia at the FIFA World Cup. Their only previous meeting was a friendly 20 years ago in Japan, prior to the 2002 tournament; Denmark won 2-1.	2	Denmark are unbeaten against African opposition at the FIFA World Cup (W2 D2) whilst Tunisia have never prevailed against European opposition at the tournament (D3 L7).	3	This will be Denmark’s sixth FIFA World Cup appearance. It’s only the second time they have qualified for back-to-back tournaments, after 1998 / 2002.	4	Denmark have made it out of the group stages in four of their five previous FIFA World Cup appearances but have never progressed further than the quarter-finals (1998, lost 3-2 to Brazil).	5	None of Denmark’s 30 goals at the FIFA World Cup have come from outside the box. No team has scored as many times in the tournament without ever finding the net from long range.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	As for Tunisia, they make three alterations to the team that lost to Brazil last time out. Mortadha Ben Ouanes, Chaalali and Jaziri come out of the side for Jebali, Meriah and Abdi. Khazri, who has been directly involved in each of Tunisia’s last four goals at the World Cup (two goals, two assists), is on the bench.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Denmark make one change to the team that beat France in the Nations League. Captain Kjaer starts in the middle of the defence, replacing Damsgaard with Hjulmand switching from a 4-3-3 to a 3-5-2.
