INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	Belgium have lost seven of their last 19 matches in all competitions (W9 D3), as many defeats as they’d suffered across their previous 74 games combined (W57 D10).	2	Morocco’s victory over Belgium was their first win in five games at the World Cup (D2 L2). Meanwhile, it was the first time that they’d recorded consecutive clean sheets at the World Cup since 1986.	3	This was the first time that Belgium have been defeated in the group stage in 14 such games at the World Cup (W8 D5), while this loss against Morocco ends an eight-game win streak in the groups.
COMMENTARY	Post Match	Magnificent Morocco can enjoy their moment! The North Africans have fully merited this victory over a stilted Belgium side. The Atlas Lions were defensively resolute and scored through Sabiri's free-kick as the Belgians failed to learn from Ziyech's ruled-out goal. The Red Devils froze, and Aboukhlal picked them off to seal a famous win.
INSIGHTS	90+5'	Morocco have scored two second half goals in a World Cup match for just the second time, last doing so against Scotland in 1998.
YELLOW CARD	90+5'	Abdelhamid Sabiri	Morocco · Midfielder #11	Sabiri picks up a late yellow card for clattering Vertonghen. He won't care much. Morocco have done it!
INSIGHTS	90+2'	Despite going off in the 75th minute, Thorgan Hazard has created twice as many chances (4) as any other player in the match.
GOOOAAALLL!!!	90+2'	Belgium	0	-	2	Morocco	Zakaria Aboukhlal	Morocco · Striker #14	Asst: H. Ziyech	GOAL! BELGIUM 0-2 MOROCCO! Aboukhlal seals the three points for Morocco! Belgium don't deal with Munir's goal-kick, and the Toulouse forward fires into the roof of the net from Ziyech's cutback!
COMMENTARY	82'	Vertonghen nods wide from Belgium's latest corner. Martinez's men are running out of time to salvage this situation.
SUBSTITUTION	81'	IN	Romelu Lukaku	Belgium · Striker #9	OUT	Thomas Meunier	Belgium · Defender #15	Belgium go for broke, bringing on Lukaku up front. Meunier is sacrificed.
SUBSTITUTION	78'	IN	Jawad El Yamiq	Morocco · Defender #18	OUT	Azzedine Ounahi	Morocco · Midfielder #8	Morocco substitution. On comes El Yamiq, a centre-back. Off goes Ounahi.
INSIGHTS	75'	Abdelhamid Sabiri has scored Morocco’s first ever direct free-kick goal at the World Cup.
SUBSTITUTION	75'	IN	Charles De Ketelaere	Belgium · Midfielder #22	OUT	Michy Batshuayi	Belgium · Striker #23	Batshuayi gets the hook too, having achieved little against the Moroccan defence. De Ketelaere enters the fray.
SUBSTITUTION	75'	IN	Leandro Trossard	Belgium · Striker #17	OUT	Thorgan Hazard	Belgium · Midfielder #16	Belgium react instantly to going behind. Trossard replaces Thorgan Hazard.
GOOOAAALLL!!!	73'	Belgium	0	-	1	Morocco	Romain Saïss	Morocco · Defender #6	Asst: A. Sabiri	GOAL! BELGIUM 0-1 MOROCCO! Sabiri gives Morocco the lead with a carbon-copy free-kick to Ziyech's earlier, except from the opposite side! Again, the North Africans crowd out Courtois, but there's no offside this time!
SUBSTITUTION	73'	IN	Zakaria Aboukhlal	Morocco · Striker #14	OUT	Sofiane Boufal	Morocco · Striker #17	Boufal's lit up the game at times, but he's run out of legs. Aboukhlal comes on for him.
SUBSTITUTION	73'	IN	Abderrazak Hamdallah	Morocco · Striker #9	OUT	Youssef En-Nesyri	Morocco · Striker #19	En-Nesyri leaves the pitch too. He's been less effective. Hamdallah takes his place up front.
SUBSTITUTION	68'	IN	Abdelhamid Sabiri	Morocco · Midfielder #11	OUT	Achraf Hakimi	Morocco · Defender #2
SUBSTITUTION	67'	IN	Yahia Attiyat Allah	Morocco · Defender #25	OUT	Selim Amallah	Morocco · Midfielder #15	Hakimi is the first Moroccan player to head off, having faded since his shot earlier. Attiat-Allah is his replacement.
INSIGHTS	65'	There were more shots on target (2) in the first seven minutes of the second half than in the whole of the first 45 minutes (1).
COMMENTARY	65'	Mertens skips past a few Moroccan defenders and blasts straight at Munir from inside the D. The Moroccan goalkeeper is well placed to make a save. That's the sort of magic that Belgium have been lacking.
SUBSTITUTION	60'	IN	Dries Mertens	Belgium · Striker #14	OUT	Eden Hazard	Belgium · Midfielder #10	The out-of-sorts Eden Hazard also makes way. Mertens takes his place on the pitch.
SUBSTITUTION	60'	IN	Youri Tielemans	Belgium · Midfielder #8	OUT	Amadou Onana	Belgium · Midfielder #18	Onana's game is indeed over. Tielemans replaces the booked midfielder for Belgium.
COMMENTARY	57'	Boufal drops a shoulder to enter the box and opens up his body to angle the ball towards the bottom right corner. He isn't too far from finding it either.
COMMENTARY	52'	The game's getting livelier now. Eden Hazard lets rip from the right of the box and forces Munir into tipping the ball out for a corner.
INSIGHTS	Half-time	Morocco have never won a World Cup game when failing to score in the first half, drawing four and losing seven of their previous 11 such games.
INSIGHTS	Half-time	Achraf Hakimi has been directly involved all three of Morocco's attempts in the first half (1 shot and 2 chances created).
INSIGHTS	Half-time	14 of the 26 games at the 2022 World Cup have been goalless at half time.
COMMENTARY	Half-time	Belgium breathe a sigh of relief as they go in at half-time. The Red Devils have had plenty of possession but haven't really tested a stubborn Morocco side. The Moroccans will be sad not to have the lead as Ziyech's goal was ruled out for offside. More to come!
COMMENTARY	45+4'	NO GOAL! BELGIUM 0-0 MOROCCO! The referee heads over to the pitchside monitor and rules the goal out for offside. Saiss had just mistimed his run as he challenged for Ziyech's ball in.
NO GOAL	45+3'	No goal! After a VAR review, a goal for Morocco is ruled out.
COMMENTARY	45+2'	GOAL! BELGIUM 0-1 MOROCCO! It's a fantastic strike from Ziyech! The Chelsea winger goes straight for goal from the free-kick, beating Courtois with a wicked effort at his near post. A few Moroccan players were there to cause confusion. Hang on! It's being checked by VAR...
COMMENTARY	39'	Saiss gives De Bruyne the chance to whip in another free-kick from the left. The midfielder does just that, as his attempt at goal dips onto the roof of the net.
COMMENTARY	35'	Chance for Morocco! Hakimi races in behind Belgium's backline. The right-back has no support so decides to go for goal himself, blasting high and wide from the right of the box.
YELLOW CARD	28'	Amadou Onana	Belgium · Midfielder #18	Onana's shown the game's first yellow card for that challenge. He'll miss Belgium's next game against Croatia.
COMMENTARY	5'	Saiss' hopeful ball in from the left gets intercepted. Belgium counter and Batshuayi gets the game's first shot on target, latching onto Thorgan Hazard's throughball to fire at goal. Munir races out to block the shot and hand the Belgians a corner.
INSIGHTS	4'	Brothers' Thorgan and Eden Hazard are starting a World Cup match together for the first time.
INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	This is the second meeting between Belgium and Morocco at the FIFA World Cup, with Belgium winning 1-0 in the other in the 1994 edition.	2	Morocco won their last meeting with Belgium in all competitions, winning 4-1 in a friendly back in March 2008. They had lost their two games against the Belgians before this.	3	Belgium have never lost a FIFA World Cup match against an African nation before (W3 D1), with all of these meetings coming in the group stage of the competition. Their most recent such match was a 5-2 win over Tunisia in 2018.	4	This is Belgium’s 50th match at the FIFA World Cup finals, the 12th different nation to reach the milestone. Just two of the previous 11 have lost their 50th game (W8 D1) – England in 2002 (vs Brazil) and Spain in 2010 (vs Switzerland), though the latter went on to win the tournament that year.	5	Belgium have won each of their last eight group stage games at the World Cup. A win here would see them become the first nation ever to win nine consecutive group games at the tournament (including second and final group rounds).
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Morocco keep the faith with the same 11 that started their solid draw with Croatia. Mazraoui is fit to start after going off on a stretcher in that game.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Belgium boss Roberto Martinez makes three changes to his team from their fortunate 1-0 win over Canada. Meunier, Onana and Thorgan Hazard come into the starting lineup.
