INSIGHTS	Post Match	1	In winning consecutive World Cup matches for the first time, Morocco have reached the knockout stages of the competition for just the second time (also in 1986).	2	Canada have lost all six of their matches at the World Cup – the joint-worst 100% losing record in the competition along with El Salvador.	3	Hakim Ziyech's opener for Morocco after three minutes and 30 seconds was the second earliest goal scored for an African nation at the World Cup, after Asamoah Gyan against Czech Republic in 2006 (68 seconds).
COMMENTARY	Post Match	Thanks to some clinical finishing and typically steadfast defending, Morocco win a second successive game at Qatar 2022 and reach the World Cup's knockout phase for the first time since 1986. Though they were forced back by an improved Canada side after the interval, the Atlas Lions top their group and become the second African nation to progress. They will now be paired up with a side from Group E, possibly Spain or Germany, and their fearless approach may make them an opponent to be wary of.
COMMENTARY	90+2'	LUCKY ESCAPE! Borjan, up into the Morocco half from his position in goal, first sends a cross into the box, which is headed away. His subsequent miskick sets Morocco clear on the counter, but Davies' exceptional pace covers his blushes and the ball is cleared.
SUBSTITUTION	85'	IN	Yahya Jabrane	Morocco · Midfielder #26	OUT	Achraf Hakimi	Morocco · Defender #2	Hakimi's job is done for today, as Jabrane comes on to replace the Paris Saint-Germain full-back for the final five minutes plus stoppage time.
YELLOW CARD	84'	Steven Vitória	Canada · Defender #5	Hamdallah goes down clutching his face, and Vitoria is booked for catching his opponent with a wayward forearm.
SUBSTITUTION	77'	IN	Jawad El Yamiq	Morocco · Defender #18	OUT	Azzedine Ounahi	Morocco · Midfielder #8	Ounahi is also replaced by Regragui, as El Yamiq now enters the fray.
SUBSTITUTION	76'	IN	Abderrazak Hamdallah	Morocco · Striker #9	OUT	Hakim Ziyech	Morocco · Striker #7	Ziyech's influence has faded since the break, so Hamdallah comes on in his place.
SUBSTITUTION	76'	IN	David Wotherspoon	Canada · Midfielder #24	OUT	Junior Hoilett	Canada · Midfielder #10	Despite a lively showing in the second half, Hoilett is taken off; Wotherspoon will make his World Cup debut.
COMMENTARY	71'	OFF THE BAR! So close to a Canada equaliser! A corner ensues from the free-kick, and from Hoilett's outswinging cross, captain Hutchinson thuds the ball against the crossbar from close range with a powerful header. It crashes down on the goal line, before Johnston narrowly heads the rebound over and onto the top of Bounou's net! What an escape for Morocco!
SUBSTITUTION	65'	IN	Richie Laryea	Canada · Defender #22	OUT	Jonathan Osorio	Canada · Midfielder #21	Canada make a fourth substitution, as Osorio comes off and Laryea is brought on.
SUBSTITUTION	65'	IN	Selim Amallah	Morocco · Midfielder #15	OUT	Abdelhamid Sabiri	Morocco · Midfielder #11	Amallah is introduced too; Sabiri makes way.
SUBSTITUTION	65'	IN	Zakaria Aboukhlal	Morocco · Striker #14	OUT	Sofiane Boufal	Morocco · Striker #17	Regragui also turns to his bench: first, Boufal is replaced by Aboukhlal.
SUBSTITUTION	61'	IN	Ismaël Koné	Canada · Midfielder #15	OUT	Sam Adekugbe	Canada · Defender #3
SUBSTITUTION	60'	IN	Atiba Hutchinson	Canada · Midfielder #13	OUT	Mark-Anthony Kaye	Canada · Midfielder #14	Herdman is going for broke, as he makes a triple substitution with half an hour to go. First, Kaye is replaced by veteran skipper Hutchinson in midfield.
SUBSTITUTION	60'	IN	Jonathan David	Canada · Striker #20	OUT	Cyle Larin	Canada · Striker #17	A straight swap up front sees Larin making way for David.
COMMENTARY	58'	WIDE! Hoilett turns the ball across the area from the right, and with a shot on the stretch at waist-height, Davies prods the ball about a yard wide of Bounou's left-hand post!
COMMENTARY	Half-time	Aided by some dubious Canadian defending, Morocco are within 45 minutes of the knockout stages, having had the better of the first half and taken their chances when presented with them. However, a momentary lapse by Aguerd gifted their opponents a route back into the game, so their one-goal advantage means there's still work to do after the interval. Canada have created little so far, with star man Davies among a muted forward line which has been subdued by the well-drilled Moroccan defence.
INSIGHTS	45+4'	Morocco have scored more own goals at the World Cup than any other African nation (3).
COMMENTARY	45+3'	GOAL RULED OUT! Following Ziyech's inswinging cross from a free-kick on the right flank, the ball drops to En-Nesyri, who ruthlessly slots home what could have been Morocco's third goal - but a flag is raised for offside. It seems there was a player in the sight-line of the keeper when his shot was taken. After a brief dramatic pause, the VAR concurs and his second strike is chalked off!
YELLOW CARD	45+2'	Sam Adekugbe	Canada · Defender #3	A late lunge by Adekugbe brings Canada a third booking of the first half, after the wing-back fells Hakimi in midfield.
INSIGHTS	43'	Youssef En-Nesyri the first Moroccan player to score at two different World Cups (1 goal in 2018 also).
INSIGHTS	40'	Nayef Aguerd's own goal is the first own goal of the 2022 World Cup, and also the 100th goal at this edition of the tournament.
OWN GOAL!	40'	Canada	1	-	2	Morocco	Nayef Aguerd	Morocco · Defender #5	Own Goal	CANADA STRIKE BACK! After Adekugbe advances on the left, the wing-back zips a dangerous low ball across the box, which Aguerd can only turn past a bemused Bounou at his near post! The goalkeeper got a glove on it, but was unable to stop the ball crossing the line! Having finally found their way into the match, Canada now have tangible reward - it's back to 1-2!
INSIGHTS	28'	This is the first time Morocco have scored twice in consecutive World Cup games, while they've now scored twice in three of their last four games at the tournament.
YELLOW CARD	26'	Jonathan Osorio	Canada · Midfielder #21	Osorio is the second Canada player to see yellow today, as he is booked for a foul on Sabiri in midfield.
GOOOAAALLL!!!	23'	Canada	0	-	2	Morocco	Youssef En-Nesyri	Morocco · Striker #19	Asst: A. Hakimi	MOROCCO HAVE TWO! A simple throughball down the right flank by Hakimi somehow catches the Canadian defence flat-footed, and En-Nesyri doesn't miss a beat. Racing onto the ball past Miller, the quick-witted then fires it into the net past Borjan at the near post! Canada 0-2 Morocco, and the Atlas Lions have one foot in the last 16!
YELLOW CARD	7'	Junior Hoilett	Canada · Midfielder #10	A clumsy late challenge on Ounahi sees Hoilett receive the game's first booking from the referee.
INSIGHTS	4'	Hakim Ziyech's goal is Morocco's first World Cup goal from outside the penalty area since Abderrazad Khairi scored against Portugal in 1986, with each of their last 13 goals in the tournament before today coming inside the area.
GOOOAAALLL!!!	4'	Canada	0	-	1	Morocco	Hakim Ziyech	Morocco · Striker #7	MOROCCO LEAD! Taking advantage of a terrible mix-up in the Canada defence, Ziyech latches on to a loose ball on the edge of the area and deftly lofts the ball over Borjan, who is wildly out of position having just given possession away! What a gift for the Atlas Lions, who roar into an early lead: 1-0 to Morocco!
INSIGHTS	1'	Hakim Ziyech has scored Morocco's earliest ever goal at a World Cup, and the second earliest by an African player, with only Asamoah Gyan vs Czech Republic in 2006 netting earlier (1 minute, 8 seconds).
INSIGHTS	0'	Achraf Hakimi and Hakim Ziyech join Mustapha Hadji on making six appearances at the World Cup, the joint most for Morocco, while Hakimi and Ziyech have now started more games at the tournament than any other player for the nation (also 6).
INSIGHTS	Pre Match	1	Morocco have never lost in three previous meetings with Canada in all competitions (W2 D1), most recently a 4-0 friendly win in October 2016.	2	This will be Morocco’s fifth FIFA World Cup game against a non-European nation, with the Atlas Lions losing each of their four previous such games (vs Peru, Saudi Arabia, Brazil and Iran).	3	Canada have been eliminated from the 2022 World Cup, having lost their first two matches. They have now lost all five of their World Cup games in total, with only El Salvador (6) playing more games while losing on each occasion.	4	Morocco earned only their third ever win at the World Cup last time out against Belgium, in what was their 18th game (D6 L9). All three of their victories have come against European nations (also beating Portugal in 1986 and Scotland in 1998).	5	This will be Canada’s first match against an African nation since October 2016, when they lost 4-0 to Morocco in Marrakech, with Hakim Ziyech scoring a brace. Canada’s only previous competitive match against a side from Africa saw them lose 2-0 to Cameroon in the Confederations Cup in 2001.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Morocco goalkeeper Bounou, who was born in Canada, withdrew from the game against Belgium just before kick-off, to be replaced by Munir; however, he is well enough to return today. Hakimi is also fit to start, so Regragui's only other change sees Sampdoria's Sabiri usurping Amallah in midfield.
COMMENTARY	Pre Match	Following his side's defeat to Croatia, John Herdman makes four changes to Canada's starting XI today, with experienced captain Hutchinson and centre-forward David among those demoted to the bench. Hoilett, Osorio, Kaye and Adekugbe all come into the lineup, and the Maple Leafs seem set to switch to a three-man defence. Meanwhile, goalkeeper Borjan dons the armband as stand-in skipper.
