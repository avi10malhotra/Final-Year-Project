Croatia had the better of the first-half chances, with Perisic and Modric firing over and Vlasic forcing a good save out of Bounou. After the break, Mazraoui saw a diving header pushed away before Livakovic denied Hakimi's powerful long-range strike.

COMMENTARY	64'	SAVE! Morocco have a free-kick through the middle, and though it's a long way out, Ziyech rolls it into Hakimi for a strike. He gets a lot of power on it and it swerves through the air, but Livakovic gets behind it to punch it away.
SUBSTITUTION	60'	IN	Yahia Attiyat Allah	Morocco · Defender #25	OUT	Noussair Mazraoui	Morocco · Defender #3	Mazraoui is carried straight down the tunnel on a stretcher, and Attiat-Allah comes on in his place.

COMMENTARY	55'	Mazraoui stayed down after his earlier header but got back to his feet to carry on. He's on the floor again now and the medical team do come on to give him treatment on his back, but he'll be able to carry on.
COMMENTARY	51'	GOOD SAVE! Boufal sees a long-range shot blocked by Lovren, and there are calls for a penalty from the Moroccan fans as they claim he used his arm. Play carried on, with Mazraoui diving forward to head it towards the near post, but Livakovic denies him.
SUBSTITUTION	46'	IN	Mario Pašalić	Croatia · Midfielder #15	OUT	Nikola Vlašić	Croatia · Striker #13	Croatia are making a change at the start of the second half. Vlasic, who needed treatment for a muscle problem at the end of the first half, is taken off, with Pasalic on for him.
COMMENTARY	Half-time	It's goalless at the break between Morocco and Croatia. The match took a while to get going, with only the one shot on target which came in stoppage-time when Vlasic's first-time shot was smothered by Bounou. Modric and Perisic also came close, but both sent their efforts over the crossbar. At the other end, En-Nesyri had a golden chance, but couldn't make contact with Ziyech's cross.
INSIGHTS	45+4'	At 45 minutes and 12 seconds, Nikola Vlasic's saved attempt was the latest first shot on target in a match at the 2022 World Cup so far.
INSIGHTS	45+3'	Morocco have never scored with a direct free-kick at the World Cup in 22 attempts.
COMMENTARY	45+2'	MODRIC! Perisic whips it in from the left this time, and Vlasic's first-time volley is blocked by Saiss, who threw himself in front of it. It bounces invitingly out to Modric and he puts his laces through it, but it flies over the bar.
COMMENTARY	45+1'	GREAT SAVE! Bounou rushes off his line to push the ball away, but Croatia quickly win it back and it's worked to Sosa on the left. He curls a dangerous cross into the six-yard box and Vlasic takes it first time, but the keeper smothers it.
COMMENTARY	42'	Vlasic has gone down off the ball and it looks like he's signalling that he's got a muscle problem. He's quickly back on his feet after treatment, and it looks like he'll be able to carry on.
COMMENTARY	18'	GREAT CHANCE! Morocco go straight down the other end and Ziyech checks back before whipping an inviting cross towards the far post. En-Nesyri just reads it wrong and he doesn't make any contact with the header as it bounces wide.
COMMENTARY	17'	CHANCE! Amallah loses the ball and the space opens up through the middle for Perisic. It's a great effort from him as he aims for the top corner, but it dips too late and sails just over the bar. It's the closest anyone has come so far!
