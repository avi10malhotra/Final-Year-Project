The result was a testament to Argentina's defensive resilience, as they managed to keep a clean sheet for the first time in the tournament. Led by Otamendi and Foyth, the backline was able to keep the Socceroos at bay for the majority of the game, only conceding in the dying minutes. The midfield trio of De Paul, Paredes and Lo Celso also played a key role in limiting Australia's chances, as they were able to break up play and keep possession in the middle of the park. Up front, Messi was the star of the show, as he was able to create chances and score the crucial opener.
Argentina cruised to the World Cup final with a decisive two-goal lead in the first half. Messi's brilliance in the second half allowed Alvarez to score again, and the Albiceleste will be in the final for the first time since 2010. Despite Modric's best efforts, Croatia's valiant run to the semi-finals was not enough, and they will now compete for third place on the weekend.
After an intense 3-3 draw, Argentina emerged victorious in the World Cup final, winning 4-2 in the penalty shootout. Messi and Di Maria scored the first-half goals for Argentina, while Mbappe's late brace took the game into extra time. Messi thought he had won it for Argentina, but Mbappe equalized from the spot to get his hat-trick. In the shootout, Martinez made a crucial save before Tchouameni missed his attempt. Argentina converted all of their penalties, with Montiel scoring the winning goal.
Despite not being a particularly impressive showing, Argentina managed to get the victory they needed against Mexico at the Lusail Stadium. Messi was the deciding factor, as he often is, after his side failed to score in the first half. His goal from 25 yards out in the second half gave them the lead and he then provided an assist for Fernandez to score the second. Mexico put up a fight but lacked quality in the attacking third, leaving them at the bottom of the group while Argentina move up to second place.
In the 10th minute, Argentina was awarded a penalty after the referee saw a foul on Paredes on the VAR monitor. Messi then converted the spot kick, sending it past Al Owais who had dived the wrong way. However, the South American team had three further goals disallowed for offside in the first half. Saudi Arabia was unable to get a shot off in the first 45 minutes, but they managed to score with both of their shots on target in the second half. Al Shehri equalised in the 48th minute after the ball deflected off Romero, and Al Dawsari put Saudi Arabia in the lead with a curling shot. Al Owais made five saves in the game, while substitute Al Amri cleared the ball off the line in the 92nd minute to secure a 2-1 win for his side.
Denmark dominated the first half, but there was little action in either penalty area. Ryan was forced to make a save when Souttar inadvertently directed Maehle's cross towards his own goal, but the goalkeeper was able to stop it with his feet. Australia had three shots on target in the first period, but all were easily saved by Schmeichel. The Socceroos began the second half strongly and were rewarded when Leckie scored the winning goal in the 60th minute. He ran 40 yards before nutmegging Maehle and finding the bottom right corner of the net. Denmark were unable to create any chances in the second half and Australia won 1-0 to advance to the knockout stages.
Belgium began their World Cup journey with a win. Canada put up a good fight and had a penalty shot from Davies saved in the first half, but Batshuayi scored just before the break to give Belgium the lead. In the second half, Belgium maintained their dominance and secured a convincing win against a formidable opponent.
The Atlas Lions of Morocco can savor their moment of glory! They have fully earned this triumph over a rigid Belgian team. Morocco was steadfast in their defense and scored through Sabiri's free-kick as the Belgians failed to take heed from Ziyech's disallowed goal. The Red Devils were paralyzed, and Aboukhlal took advantage to secure a remarkable victory.
After failing to capitalize on several opportunities in the first half, Brazil came out strong after the break and kept Serbia on the defensive. Richarlison opened the scoring in the 62nd minute, taking advantage of the ball that Vanja Milinkovic-Savic had parried and smashing it into the goal. Richarlison then scored again in the 73rd minute with an impressive acrobatic volley to seal the victory. Serbia were unable to mount any serious offensive pressure, leaving Brazil's defense untested.
Brazil put on an amazing show in the first half, with Vinicius, Neymar, Richarlison and Paqueta all scoring to give them a four-goal lead at the break. They relaxed a bit in the second half, allowing Korea Republic to get a consolation goal from Seung-Ho Paik, but it was too late to make a difference.
Brazil have managed to secure their place in the last 16 after a hard-fought win. Casemiro's goal in the 83rd minute was the difference between the two sides, after Vinicius' earlier effort was disallowed for offside. Switzerland put up a good fight, but Brazil's superior quality in the attacking third eventually paid off. The Selecao are now through to the knockout stages, while Switzerland will need to beat Serbia in their last game to join them.
Cameroon have pulled off a stunning victory over Brazil, but it ultimately proves to be in vain. Vincent Aboubakar's late header sent the crowd into a frenzy, as Cameroon snatched a win in a match that Brazil had largely been in control of. The Selecao had plenty of chances to score, but their finishing let them down, and Brazil couldn't end their group stage campaign with a win. Despite Switzerland's 3-2 win over Serbia, Brazil will still finish top of Group G, but this result means that Cameroon's World Cup journey is over, as they needed the Swiss to draw or lose in order to progress.
Aboubakar came in as a substitute and made a huge impact, scoring and assisting in Cameroon's comeback draw with Serbia in a World Cup classic. The game began with Cameroon taking the lead after Mitrovic failed to convert two chances, with Castelletto capitalising on Tolo's corner. Serbia responded with two goals in first half stoppage time, with Pavlovic heading in Tadic's free-kick and Milinkovic-Savic curling his effort into the bottom corner. Serbia looked to have secured the win when Mitrovic scored, but Song made a substitution, bringing on Aboubakar. The 30-year-old scored a delicate chip, which was confirmed by VAR, and then set up the equaliser two minutes later, providing Choupo-Moting with an easy finish.
Morocco have secured their place in the knockout phase of the World Cup for the first time since 1986, after winning their second consecutive game at Qatar 2022. Despite being pushed back by a stronger Canada side in the second half, the Atlas Lions held firm and topped their group, becoming the second African nation to progress. They will now face a team from Group E, possibly Spain or Germany, and their determined attitude could make them a formidable opponent.
Despite coming from behind to defeat Costa Rica, Germany have been eliminated from the World Cup after Havertz scored a brace. Gnabry opened the scoring with a header, but Tejeda equalized with a shot into the bottom corner after Neuer fumbled Waston's header. Vargas' flick was then directed into the net by Neuer, giving Costa Rica the lead. However, Havertz responded quickly and put Germany back in front with a shot past Navas, before Fullkrug scored the fourth goal after Sane set him up. Initially disallowed for offside, the goal was eventually given after VAR intervened.
Croatia progressed to the World Cup round of 16 after playing out a scoreless draw with Belgium in their Group F match. Romelu Lukaku had four chances to save the Red Devils from an early exit, but he was unable to convert any of them, hitting the post and missing from close range. Croatia's defense was able to keep the Belgians at bay, allowing them to advance in second place in the group, while Morocco took the top spot after their victory over Canada.
Croatia have advanced to the semi-finals of the World Cup for the second consecutive tournament after a 4-2 penalty shootout victory over Brazil following a 1-1 draw in the quarter-final. Neymar had seemingly put the Selecao on the brink of the last four with a stunning goal in the first period of extra time, but Bruno Petkovic equalised with a deflected effort to keep Croatia alive in the second half of extra time. Dominik Livakovic then made a crucial save from Rodrygo Silva's penalty, and Zlatko Dalic's team were perfect in the shootout, with Marquinhos' attempt hitting the post and sending Croatia through and Brazil out of the tournament at the quarter-final stage.
Canada scored their first-ever goal in a World Cup match just two minutes into the game, but Croatia was able to come back and win 4-1 at the Khalifa International Stadium. Davies' goal gave the Canucks a brief lead, but Kramaric equalized for Dalic's team shortly after. Livaja's goal just before the end of the first half put Croatia ahead, and two more goals in the second half sealed the victory. Despite their efforts, Canada were unable to get a result and are now eliminated from the tournament.
Croatia earned a 2-1 victory over Morocco in the World Cup, securing third place in the tournament. Gvardiol opened the scoring with a diving header in the seventh minute, but Morocco responded quickly with Dari's close-range header. Orsic then put Croatia back in the lead just before half-time with a curling shot off the far post. Morocco had two great opportunities in the second half to take the game to extra time, but Livakovic blocked En-Nesyri's shot and the forward sent a header over the bar in the dying seconds.
At the end of an exciting match, Denmark were denied a penalty in the dying moments. Referee Cesar Arturo Ramos was asked to review the incident on the monitor, but he decided against awarding the spot-kick. Tunisia had the better of the chances in the first half, with Jebali having a goal disallowed for offside and then being denied by Schmeichel. Denmark improved in the second half, with Eriksen having an effort pushed wide and Cornelius missing a great opportunity when he hit the post with the goal gaping.
Senegal advanced to the elimination round for the first time since 2002 after a 2-1 victory over Ecuador. Sarr earned a penalty kick when Hincapie collided with him, and he confidently put it in the back of the net. Ecuador attempted to come back in the second half, and Caicedo scored from a corner to tie the game. However, only two and a half minutes later, Senegal regained the lead when Idrissa Gueye's free-kick was deflected to Koulibaly, who volleyed in the winning goal.
France have advanced to the semi-finals of the World Cup after a 2-1 victory over England. Tchouameni opened the scoring with a powerful shot into the bottom corner in the 17th minute. England responded well in the second half and were awarded a penalty when Saka was fouled, which Kane converted. Giroud then put France back in front with a header in the 78th minute, but Kane missed a chance to level the score from the penalty spot, sending his effort over the bar.
England began their World Cup journey with a resounding 6-2 victory over Iran. At the half-time whistle, the Three Lions had already established a 3-0 lead, with Bellingham netting his first England goal, followed by Saka and Sterling. Saka scored his second shortly after the hour mark, but Taremi responded with a goal off the underside of the bar. Substitutes Rashford and Grealish then sealed the win, with Rashford scoring just 49 seconds after coming on. The game was completed with a late penalty from Taremi, after a foul by Stones.
The final whistle blows, confirming England's advancement to the quarterfinals of the World Cup! The Three Lions started the second half as strongly as they ended the first, with Saka scoring their third goal within 12 minutes of the restart. England then kept Senegal at bay, almost adding to their lead multiple times and only allowing them a few shots on goal as they secured a 3-0 win, setting up an exciting matchup with France in the next round.
England and USA have played to a fifth scoreless draw in this World Cup, and it was a match that neither team deserved to win. The Americans put pressure on the English in the first hour, but Southgate's team managed to contain them. Despite their efforts, they were unable to break through the well-structured defense of their opponents, and the game eventually ended without a goal.
France began their World Cup title defense with a convincing victory over Australia, despite conceding an early goal from Goodwin that was the quickest of the tournament. The French team responded with four unanswered goals, with Giroud scoring twice and Mbappe putting on a stellar performance.
Mbappe's goal late in the match secured the victory for France, who had a 2-1 win over Denmark at Stadium 974. After a first half that lacked finishing, both teams came alive in the second half, with Mbappe connecting with Hernandez to score the opener. Denmark responded shortly after, with Eriksen's corner finding Andersen, who set up Christensen to equalise. However, four minutes from time, Griezmann's cross was met by Mbappe to give France the win and secure their place in the knockout stages. Denmark must now beat Australia in their final match to progress.
France progressed to the World Cup final for the second consecutive time after a 2-0 victory over Morocco in their semi-final match. Theo Hernandez opened the scoring for Les Bleus in the fifth minute with a close-range finish following a blocked shot from Kylian Mbappe. Morocco had a chance to equalize when Jawad El Yamiq hit the post, but France held firm at the back and sealed the win with a goal from substitute Randal Kolo Muani, who scored his first international goal to send his team to the final.
France progressed to the quarter-finals of the World Cup after a 3-1 victory over Poland in the round-of-16. Olivier Giroud made history by scoring his 52nd goal for France, surpassing Thierry Henry as the nation's all-time leading goalscorer. Kylian Mbappe put on a show with two brilliant goals, taking his total to five at the tournament. Robert Lewandowski scored a penalty in the dying minutes for Poland, but their World Cup campaign has now come to an end.
Can you believe it?! Itakura's long ball from a free-kick in his own half is met by Asano, who takes a perfect first touch and sprints into the box. He then unleashes a shot from a difficult angle, which beats Neuer and finds the back of the net! What a turnaround, what a story, and what a goal to put Japan 2-1 up!!! GOOOOOOAAAAALLLL!!!!
Despite Uruguay's 2-0 victory, both Uruguay and Ghana have been eliminated from the World Cup. Andre Ayew had the opportunity to give Ghana the lead with a penalty kick, but his shot was saved. De Arrascaeta then scored two goals in six minutes, putting Uruguay in a strong position to advance to the next round. However, South Korea's late goal in the other game resulted in Uruguay's elimination. VAR denied Uruguay a penalty, and despite their efforts, neither team was able to score in the extra time.
Iran put forth their best effort against the USA, but the Americans had the upper hand in quality and deserved the victory. They were particularly dominant in the first half, scoring their only goal in the 38th minute through Pulisic. Iran improved in the second half, with Rezaeian displaying a lot of skill on the right side, but they were unable to get a shot past Turner.
Costa Rica, who had been defeated by Spain in their first match, pulled off a stunning upset by beating Japan, the team that had previously defeated Germany. After a strong defensive performance, Los Ticos took advantage of Japan's ineffective attack to withstand the pressure in the second half and score the winning goal late in the match. Fuller's goal in the 81st minute put Costa Rica on the same number of points as both Japan and Group E leaders Spain, even though they had only qualified for the tournament after winning a playoff against New Zealand.
Both teams began the match with a lot of energy, but as time went on, Croatia began to take control of the game and slow the pace. Perisic had Croatia's best chance of the half, but Gonda was able to deny him from close range after a mistake from Tomiyasu. Japan gained some momentum towards the end of the half and Maeda capitalized on it, scoring his first goal of the tournament off of Yoshida's knockdown in the 43rd minute. The only highlight of the second half was Perisic's equalizer, as his powerful header could not be stopped by Gonda. Extra time was relatively quiet, with the only chance being a deflected effort from Mitoma. In the penalty shootout, Livakovic was the hero, saving three of the four Japan penalties, with only Asano scoring. Pasalic then dispatched the winning penalty, giving Croatia the 3-1 victory in the shootout.
Both Japan and Spain have advanced to the Round of 16 after a thrilling match between the two teams. Morata put Spain ahead in the first half, but Japan responded with two goals from Doan and Tanaka in the second half. Germany's victory over Costa Rica in the other game in the group sealed the deal, with Japan topping the group and Spain coming in second.
Mexico and Poland ended their World Cup Group C match at Stadium 974 in a scoreless draw. Robert Lewandowski had the best opportunity of the game, but his penalty kick was unsuccessful after he was brought down by Hector Moreno. Neither team was able to generate many chances in the attacking third, and the draw was a fair outcome, giving each side one point in their opening match of the tournament.
The game ended without a goal, with Morocco and Croatia unable to break the deadlock. Both teams had two shots on target each, with Croatia having the better of the first-half chances. Perisic and Modric both missed the target, while Vlasic forced a good save from Bounou. In the second half, Mazraoui had a diving header saved, and Livakovic denied Hakimi's powerful long-range effort.
Morocco made history as they became the first African team to reach the World Cup semi-finals, after a hard-fought victory over Portugal in Al Thumama. The Atlas Lions put on a defensive masterclass, and En-Nesyri's header in the first half sealed the deal. Despite having to contend with several injuries, they were cheered on by their passionate fans, and having eliminated Belgium, Spain, and now Portugal, they will face either England or France in the semi-finals.
For the first time in their history, Morocco advanced to the quarter-finals of the World Cup after a penalty shootout victory over Spain. Aguerd had a good chance in the first half, but the game remained scoreless for the majority of the match. Bounou made a crucial save from Olmo in the second half, and Simon denied Cheddira in extra-time. Sarabia hit the post with the last kick of the game, sending it to penalties. Spain were unable to convert any of their three spot-kicks, while Morocco were successful with all four of theirs. Simon saved Benoun's penalty, and Sabiri, Ziyech, and Hakimi all scored to send Regragui’s side through.
The match is finished, and Argentina have advanced to the semifinals after a close victory in a penalty shootout. The Netherlands had a late surge of momentum with two goals from Wout Weghorst, but were unable to score another in the extra time. In the end, two great saves from Emi Martinez gave Argentina the edge, and they will now face Croatia in the semi-finals.
GOOOOAAAALLLL!!!! Estupinan makes the most of his opportunity, firing a low shot from the edge of the box that the keeper parries, but Valencia is there to make sure it counts this time, equalizing the score at 1-1. After being denied a goal at the end of the first half, Ake plays Valencia onside and they get the goal they deserve to start the second!
The Netherlands have advanced to the World Cup round of 16 after a convincing 2-0 victory over Qatar in their last Group A match. Cody Gakpo and Frenkie de Jong scored the goals that secured the three points for the Oranje, allowing them to finish the group as the top team. Qatar, on the other hand, ended their campaign with three losses.
The Netherlands put on a masterful display to advance to the quarterfinals of Qatar 2022, outplaying a spirited USA team. The Oranje used their experience and the guidance of their renowned coach to take advantage of the USA's inexperience, scoring three times with Dumfries involved in each goal. The first was a classic example of Total Football, and though the USA managed to score a goal in the second half, the Netherlands ultimately earned their place in the quarterfinals.
The match at Stadium 974 is finished, and Argentina have advanced to the knockout stage! The South Americans completely dominated Poland, with Mac Allister and Alvarez scoring the goals. Argentina could have had even more, as Messi had a penalty saved in the first half. Poland is undoubtedly relieved that they didn't concede any more.
Poland earned three points to put themselves in a strong position to advance to the Round of 16 before the last game of the group stage. Saudi Arabia put up a good fight, but goals from Zielinski and Lewandowski were the difference-makers, as was Al Dawsari's missed penalty. They put in a solid performance.
Portugal started their World Cup campaign with a thrilling 3-2 win over Ghana at the 974 Stadium. After a scoreless first half, Cristiano Ronaldo scored the first goal of the tournament with a contentious penalty, becoming the first player to score at five World Cups. Andre Ayew levelled the score for the Black Stars, but Joao Felix and Rafael Leao both scored their first World Cup goals to give the Selecao a two-goal lead. Osman Bukari's close-range header made for a tense finish, and Diogo Costa almost set up Inaki Williams for an equaliser in stoppage time, only for the forward to slip at the crucial moment. Fernando Santos' team held on to secure the three points and get off to a winning start in Group H.
Portugal have advanced to the World Cup quarter-finals in spectacular fashion, dominating Switzerland in Lusail. Sergio Ramos' hat-trick will be the talk of the town, but it was a collective effort from the Portuguese that earned them the victory. Manager Fernando Santos made all the right moves, and the Swiss were out of the game by the end of the first half.
Portugal advanced to the knockout stages after a 2-0 victory over Uruguay. Fernandes opened the scoring with a curling shot that was meant to be a cross, although Ronaldo attempted to claim it as a header. Uruguay had a few chances to equalize, with Gomez hitting the post, Suarez and De Arrascaete coming close, and Gimenez being called for a handball. Fernandes then converted the penalty kick, and almost completed a hat-trick in stoppage time, but his shot hit the post.
Ecuador earned a 2-0 win against Qatar in the opening match of the 2022 World Cup at the Al Bayt Stadium. Enner Valencia had a header disallowed for offside by VAR in the third minute, but he soon made up for it by scoring from the penalty spot after being fouled by Saad Al Sheeb. Valencia then doubled his side's lead with a powerful header from Angel Preciado's cross. Qatar had a chance to get back into the game before halftime, but Almoez Ali's header went wide. Ecuador held on in the second half to secure the win and three points in Group A.
Senegal earned their first victory of the 2022 World Cup with a 3-1 triumph over Qatar. Dia capitalized on Khoukhi's mistake to score just before the half-time whistle, and Diedhiou doubled their lead with a header from a corner three minutes after the break. Qatar did manage to get on the scoresheet when Muntari headed in a goal, but Dieng sealed the win late on with a first-time strike.
Mexico's dreams of advancing to the next round of the World Cup were dashed despite a 2-1 victory over Saudi Arabia. Mexico dominated the match from the start and were rewarded with a goal two minutes into the second half when Martin scored from close range. Chavez then added to their lead with an incredible long-range free-kick. Despite needing a third goal to overtake Poland in the standings, Lozano and Antuna both had goals disallowed for offsides before Al Dawsari put an end to their hopes with a late consolation goal for Saudi Arabia.
GOOOOAAAALLL!!! Depay has done it! He's gone past Koulibaly and fired a shot that Mendy couldn't keep out. Klaassen was there to make sure of the goal, and the Dutch have secured a 2-0 win over Senegal!
Switzerland have advanced to the knockout stage of the World Cup after Freuler's second-half goal secured a victory over Serbia in a thrilling match. Both teams were evenly matched in the first half, but the Swiss gained the upper hand in the second and never looked back.
At the beginning of the game, South Korea seemed to be the more likely team to score, but Salisu changed that in the 24th minute when he put Ghana ahead. Jordan Ayew had sent in a threatening free-kick into the six-yard box and South Korea failed to clear it, allowing Salisu to take advantage and score. Kudus then added to the lead with a header off of another Ayew cross. South Korea attempted a comeback in the second half with two headers from Cho, but Kudus responded with his own brace to put Ghana ahead again. Despite South Korea's efforts to get a third goal, Ghana held on for the 3-2 victory.
Portugal got off to a quick start after Horta scored in his World Cup debut in the first five minutes. South Korea responded twenty minutes later when Kim Young-gwon capitalized on a mistake from Ronaldo. The first half was slow-paced with both teams being cautious in their build-up play. Portugal had the upper hand, forcing Kim Seung-gyu to make five saves. The second half was relatively quiet until Son Heung-min broke away and Hwang Hee-chan scored the winning goal in the 91st minute, sending South Korea to the knockout rounds.
Despite facing minimal opposition, Spain put on a superb performance in their first game of the 2022 World Cup, scoring seven goals against Costa Rica. Olmo opened the scoring early on, and the Spanish team proceeded to dominate possession and control the match. Costa Rica were unable to get a single shot off, and Spain's young players shone. This sets up an exciting match against Germany this weekend.
The game ended in a tie, with both teams getting a share of the points. Spain had taken the lead in the second half through Morata, but Germany's Fullkrug equalised in the last 10 minutes. The result was a fair one, keeping Germany in contention for the final game of the group phase. Spain are still at the top of Group E, but they have yet to secure their spot in the Round of 16.
Switzerland got off to a successful start in Group G with Embolo scoring the only goal of the game. Xhaka initiated the move, sending the ball to Shaqiri who then found Embolo in the box. Unmarked, the striker fired the ball past Onana who had no chance of stopping it. Vargas had a chance to double Switzerland's lead, but Onana was able to push the shot wide. Cameroon had their own opportunities to score in the first half, with Mbeumo and Hongla both having shots on goal that were saved by Sommer.
Australia earned their first World Cup win since 2010 by defeating Tunisia 1-0. Mitchell Duke scored the decisive goal with a header off of Craig Goodwin's cross. Tunisia attempted to equalize with shots from Youssef Msakni, but the Socceroos' defense, led by Harry Souttar, was able to keep them at bay and secure the victory.
Tunisia have made history with their win over France, despite the fact that it was not enough to send them through to the last 16. Wahbi Khazri's goal was the difference between the two sides, and although France pushed hard for an equaliser, VAR denied Antoine Griezmann's effort. This victory will be remembered for a long time in Tunisian football.
The match between the US and Wales ended in a 1-1 draw, with the US dominating the first half with a lively performance and Wales responding with a more direct approach in the second. Both teams are content with the result, but Wales is especially pleased to have salvaged something from a game they had difficulty getting a grip on in the first half. Bale was the hero for Wales, scoring the equalizer late in the game.
The first 45 minutes of the game were evenly matched, with both teams having their moments. South Korea had the best opportunity in the 34th minute when Ui-Jo was left open in the box, but his shot went over the bar. Uruguay's best chance came just before the break when Godin's header from a corner hit the post. The second half was relatively quiet until the end when Valverde's long-range effort hit the post in the 90th minute and Son shot wide at the other end after a mistake from Rochet. Neither team was able to score, and the game ended in a 0-0 draw.
England put on a great show today, easily advancing to the next round of the tournament. Rashford scored two goals and Foden added another, leading the Three Lions to victory against Wales, who put in a lackluster performance. This may be the end of Wales' successful period, while England move on to the round of 16 as the top team in Group B.
Taremi drives forward with the ball, looking for a teammate to pass to. Rezaeian sprints up from the right-back position and sends a chip shot over Ward and into the goal, securing the victory for Iran with a score of 2-0. Wales are left one goal behind as the game ends. GOAALLLL! GAME OVER!
