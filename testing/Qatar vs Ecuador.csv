Ecuador secure a 2-0 victory over Qatar in the first match of the 2022 World Cup at the Al Bayt Stadium. El Tri saw a third-minute header from Enner Valencia disallowed for offside by VAR, but Valencia soon got his side up and running scoring from the penalty spot after he was fouled by Saad Al Sheeb. The Ecuador captain then extended his side's lead with a brilliant header from Angel Preciado's cross. Almoez Ali missed Qatar's best chance of the game before the interval, heading wide from close range. Ecuador saw out the result in the second half with ease to notch a victory and three vital points in Group A.
31'	GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!! VALENCIA SCORES A SUPER HEADER!!!!! 2-0 ECUADOR!!!!! Valencia doubles Ecuador's lead with a perfect header into the bottom-left corner. Caicedo makes a break forward into the Qatar half, but sees his initial throughball blocked. He works a ball out wide to Preciado on the right flank, who whips a fine cross into the middle. Estrada fails to make contact, but Valencia places his header to perfection away from Al Sheeb into the net.
16'	GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!! VALENCIA FIRES ECUADOR AHEAD!!!!! 1-0!!!! El Tri do have the lead on this occasion as Valencia holds his composure to slot his effort into the bottom-right corner. Al Sheeb guesses incorrectly and it allows Ecuador to get off the mark in the World Cup.
