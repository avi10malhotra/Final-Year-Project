GOOOOAAAALLLL!!!! And this time it WILL count!!! Estupinan is found in open space down the left and drills a low shot from the edge of the box. He gets down well and parries it, but Valencia is on hand to stab the ball into back of the net to make it 1-1! They were denied by the flag right at the end of the first half, but Ake plays Valencia onside here, meaning they do get their just reward right at the start of the second!
6'	GOOOOOAAAALLL!!!! What an early strike that is!!! Klaassen does well to rein in a deflected pass, before feeding Gakpo. He takes one step to the left before shooting with his left foot, and rifling the ball straight into the top corner! That's his second of the tournament, and what a way to get it as he puts the Oranje 1-0 up!
