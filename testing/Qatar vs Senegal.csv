Senegal get their first win of the 2022 World Cup with a 3-1 victory over Qatar. Dia opened the scoring just before half-time when he took advantage of Khoukhi's slip to roll his shot past Barsham into the back of the net. Just three minutes after the break, Diedhiou doubled their lead with a glancing header from a corner. Qatar did grow into the game and got their first-ever World Cup goal when substitute Muntari thumped in a header, but Dieng wrapped it up late on with a first-time strike.
84'	DIENG SCORES! Senegal have their two-goal cushion back! Sabaly knocks it onto Ndiaye down the right and he pulls it back into the middle. Dieng held his run, losing Khoukhi, before turning his first-time shot past the diving Barsham and into the back of the net. 3-1 Senegal!
78'	MUNTARI SCORES! Qatar have their first-ever goal at a World Cup! It's a wonderful switch out to Mohammad on the right and he has time to set himself before curling a cross into the middle. Muntari wants it more and he gets above Koulibaly to thump a header past Mendy into the far post. 2-1!
48'	DIEDHIOU SCORES! Senegal win a corner and it's a good delivery from Jakobs. Diedhiou makes the run to the near post on the edge of the six-yard box, and he stoops before flicking his header over Barsham and into the far top corner. 2-0 Senegal!
41'	DIA SCORES! And it's a moment to forget for Khoukhi! Diatta swings a cross in from the left and Khoukhi loses his footing as he tries to clear his lines. The ball bounces up off his hip and drops kindly for Dia, who rolls it past Barsham to put Senegal 1-0 up!
