It's all over, and Brazil sneak the victory in a game they were far from their best in to secure qualification to the last 16! Casemiro's thumping finish seven minutes from time grants them all three points, after an earlier goal by Vinicius was ruled out for an offside in the build-up. Switzerland did threaten going forward, but Brazil kept them at bay relatively easily, and eventually their quality in the final third told as Casemiro lashed in the winner. The Selecao are home and dry in the knockouts, while Switzerland have plenty to do in their final game against Serbia in order to join them.
83'	GOOOOAAAALLL!!! Brazil have their breakthrough this time!!! Vinicius' inside pass is flicked on by Rodrygo, and the ball takes one bounce in the box before Casemiro smashes a half-volley that sends the ball spiralling into the far corner!! That's one hell of an improvised finish by the defensive midfielder, and it finally puts the Selecao 1-0 up!
