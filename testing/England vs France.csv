France are through to the semi-finals of the World Cup after a 2-1 win over England. The holders broke the deadlock in the 17th minute through Tchouameni's long-range strike into the bottom corner. England made a bright start to the second half, though, and were awarded a penalty after Saka was tripped, and Kane fired it into the back of the net. Giroud restored France's lead in the 78th minute with a header from close range and the Three Lions had another chance to equalise from the spot, but Kane blazed that one high over the bar.
78'	GIROUD SCORES! And France restore their lead! Griezmann's corner is cleared, but it's worked back out to him on the left. It's a brilliant cross and Giroud just gets in front of Maguire to thump a header past Pickford at the near post. 2-1 France!
54'	KANE SCORES! The referee's whistle goes, but Kane goes back to reposition the ball on the spot and make Lloris wait a bit longer. When he does step up, it's a brilliant spot-kick as he fires it to the left, sending Lloris the wrong way to pull England level. 1-1!
17'	TCHOUAMENI SCORES! It's a brilliant counter-attack from France! Mbappe rides the challenge from Rice as he switches to the right, and Griezmann pulled it back to Tchouameni. He's a long way out, but he gets it out of his feet and fires through Bellingham's legs and into the bottom-left corner. 1-0 France!
