Canada’s first-ever lead in a World Cup came just 120 seconds into the match but it wasn’t enough to keep their hopes alive as Croatia come back to win 4-1 at the Khalifa International Stadium. Davies gave the Canucks their first-ever goal at a World Cup finals, but the advantage lasted just over a half-hour, before Kramaric pulled Dalic’s men back level with an accurate strike. Livaja’s finish a minute before injury time gave the 2018 finalists a 2-1 lead at the half, more or less confirming the result. To their credit, Canada remained positive and looked for a result until the end but confusion at the back would cost them two more after the interval with Perisic linking up with Kramaric for the second time in the game after 70 minutes, before a late Majer tap-in put the finishing touches on the win. The three points give Dalic’s side a chance to finish the group on top, while Canada are eliminated.
90+4'	CROATIA HAVE A FOURTH! 4-1! Miller’s mistake as the last man back allows two Croatia forwards to storm through, with Orsic picking up possession and bursting into the penalty area before squaring it to Majer for the easy finish!
70'	KRAMARIC NETS HIS SECOND! 3-1 CROATIA! Perisic again pulls the strings from the left edge of the penalty area, teasing a beautiful cross to the far post for Kramaric. The forward takes a touch to bring himself closer to goal before firing a low shot into the bottom corner!
44'	CROATIA TAKE THE LEAD! 2-1! A lovely incisive run by Juranovic gets Croatia up the pitch near Canada’s penalty area, where Miller puts in a sliding challenge. The ball bobbles and comes back to the attacking full-back, who splits the legs of the defender with a pass to Livaja. From there, the striker takes a touch to set himself before beating Borjan coolly!
36'	CROATIA PULL LEVEL! 1-1! A quick bit of passing from Dalic’s side opens up a pocket of space for Perisic on the left corner of the penalty area. He plays a smart disguised pass into the box for Kramaric, who dispatches his finish with confidence!
2'	CANADA’S FIRST GOAL AT THE WORLD CUP! WHO ELSE BUT DAVIES? 1-0! Buchanan whips a lovely cross into the penalty area between Lovren and Juranovic, with Davies storming in to meet it. The wing-back rises highest and powers a header past Livakovic to give his side the lead within 120 seconds!
