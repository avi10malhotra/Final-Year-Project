Portugal are through to the knockout stages after a 2-0 win over Uruguay. Portugal took the lead with their first shot on target. Fernandes curled what was supposed to be a cross straight into the net, and though Ronaldo tried to claim a deft header, he didn't get a touch. Gomez hit the post for Uruguay before Suarez and De Arrascaete also came close. A dubious handball decision went against Gimenez and Fernandes coolly slotted the penalty home, before being denied a hat-trick by the post deep in stoppage time.
90+3'	FERNANDES SCORES! He wasn't originally stood over the spot-kick, but he coolly steps up to take it. It's a slow run-up and he stutters it just in front of the ball before doing his trademark hop and calmly slotting the ball down the left of the goal, sending the keeper the wrong way. 2-0 Portugal!
54'	FERNANDES SCORES! Portugal open the scoring with their first shot on target in the game! Guerreiro touches it into Fernandes, who looks to run down the left before changing his mind and cutting back inside. He curls what looks like a great cross to Ronaldo in the middle, but it's just too high for him and it beats Rochet. 1-0 Portugal!
