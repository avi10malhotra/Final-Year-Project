Though met by little in the way of resistance, Spain put on a passing masterclass in their opening match of the 2022 World Cup, and show a clinical side in hitting hapless Costa Rica for seven. After Olmo's early goal broke the deadlock, Luis Enrique's side pushed forward relentlessly and dominated the ball to an almost comical extent - the Costa Ricans barely had a kick, and failed to manage even a single shot at goal. With several young starlets impressing for La Roja, the stage is now set for a seismic clash with Germany this weekend.
90+2'	SPAIN STRIKE SEVEN! Morata gets in on the act now, as his run off the defender's shoulder is met with a precise throughball from Olmo, and he then slots the ball past Navas and into the bottom-left corner! Spain 7-0 Costa Rica!!
90'	SPAIN HIT SIX! Substitute Soler adds another for La Roja, as Navas can't fully clear a low cross whipped over from the right by Williams, and the Valencia midfielder coolly steers the ball into the bottom corner from close range! That puts Spain 6-0 up, and Costa Rica just want this game to end!
74'	GAVI GETS THE FIFTH! Spain's record breaker steers home a delightful volley from just inside the box, using the outside of his boot to guide the ball home via the right-hand post! Not only La Roja's youngest-ever player at a World Cup, the Barcelona wonderkid adds a goal from Morata's cross! Spain 5-0 Costa Rica!
54'	FOUR FOR SPAIN! Aided by some awful defending, Torres strikes again to put Spain 4-0 up with his 15th international goal. Having bundled his way into the box, Oviedo fails to deal with the forward's turn and allows him to turn the ball past a helpless Navas from close range!
31'	SPAIN LEAD BY THREE! Outfoxing Navas with a skip at the end of his run-up, Torres dinks the ball into the back of the net from the penalty spot and puts his nation three goals to the good!
21'	ASENSIO STRIKES! Spain go 2-0 up! Alba's low cross from the left edge of the area slices through the rather static Costa Rica defence, and Asensio reacts first to sweep the ball home via a desperate fingertip from Navas. The veteran goalkeeper can only guide it into the bottom corner, and his side trail by two!
11'	SPAIN LEAD! As reward for their incessant attacking from the first whistle, La Roja go ahead early on! Gavi finds a yard of space just outside the area and chips a delicate ball over the top, which then deflects into the path of Olmo, who calmly steers the ball past an exposed Navas! Spain's 100th World Cup goal puts them 1-0 up!
