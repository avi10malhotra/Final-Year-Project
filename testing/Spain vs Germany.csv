The spoils are shared. Spain took the lead early in the second half through Morata only for Fullkrug to equalise for Germany inside the final 10 minutes. In truth, a draw is a fair result and keeps Germany alive heading into the final game of the group phase. Spain are top of Group E, but haven't yet confirmed their place in the Round of 16.
83'	GOAL! Fullkrug equalises for Germany. The substitute comes steaming into the box, taking the ball off Musiala's toe before smashing it into the back of the net.
62'	GOAL! Spain take the lead. Alba is played in down the left flank by Busquets before lifting his head and crossing the ball to find Morata in the box. He times his run to perfection before directing his first-time finish into the back of the net.
