It may not have been a memorable performance, but Argentina get the win they needed, beating Mexico 2-0 at the Lusail Stadium to keep their hopes of qualification alive. As is so often the case, Messi proved to be the difference after a first half in which his side failed to hit the target. His goal from 25 yards out midway through the second half sneaked into the bottom corner to give the Albiceleste the lead and he would turn provider 23 minutes later, setting Fernandez up for a wonderful second. Mexico were determined but lacked quality in the final third, with the result dropping them to the bottom of the section, while Argentina climb into second.
87'	WHAT A GOAL! 2-0 ARGENTINA! Itâ€™s a sublime strike from Fernandez, who receives a pass from Messi following a short-corner routine and executes a couple of stepovers ahead of Gutierrez before dispatching a curling effort into the top corner!
64'	WHO ELSE BUT MESSI?! 1-0 ARGENTINA! Just when his side need it most, Messi pops up with a bit of magic, finding the bottom corner from 25 yards out with a crowd of bodies in the way!
