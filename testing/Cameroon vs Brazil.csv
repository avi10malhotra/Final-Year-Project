It's all over, as Cameroon seal a famous win over Brazil that ultimately comes in vain. Vincent Aboubakar's late header caused pandemonium, as Cameroon snatched a win in a game which was largely dominated by Brazil. The Selecao peppered Epassy's goal at times, but their finishing let them down, and Brazil couldn't finish their group stage campaign with a flourish. They'll still top Group G though, despite Switzerland's 3-2 win over Serbia, but that result spells the end of Cameroon's tournament, who needed the Swiss to draw or lose in order to progress at their expense.
90+2'	GOOOOOOOOAAAAAALLLLLL!!!!!!! Cameroon score, and Brazil are shocked!!!!!!!! Ngom Mbekeli bursts down the right wing and fires an absolute peach of a cross into the box, and Aboubakar ghosts between the two centre-backs to notch a lovely cushioned header beyond Ederson and into the bottom corner!!! Cameroon lead 1-0, and if Serbia can equalise against Switzerland, they will go through to the last 16!
