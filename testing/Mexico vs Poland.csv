Mexico and Poland play out a goalless draw in their World Cup Group C clash at Stadium 974. Robert Lewandowski missed the best chance of the game as he failed to convert from the penalty spot after being fouled by Hector Moreno. Both teams struggled to create chances in the final third and the draw was the fair result in the end, allowing the two sides to add a point each to their tallies in their first match of the tournament.
