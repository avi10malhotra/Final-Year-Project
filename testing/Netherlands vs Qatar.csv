The Netherlands are safely through to the World Cup round of 16 courtesy of a 2-0 win over Qatar in their final Group A game. Goals from Cody Gakpo and Frenkie de Jong secured the three points for the Oranje to send them into the next round as group winners. They were never troubled by Qatar, who ended their campaign with three defeats.
49'	GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!! DE JONG SCORES ON THE REBOUND!!!!! 2-0 NETHERLANDS!!!!!! De Jong pounces from close range to double Netherlands' lead. Klaassen whips a cross to the back post that finds Depay, who fires at goal from point-blank range. Barsham makes a great reaction stop, but De Jong is first to the rebound and steers a strike into an empty net.
26'	GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!! GAKPO SCORES AGAIN!!!!!! 1-0 NETHERLANDS!!! The Oranje take the lead as Gakpo takes Klaassen's pass in his stride before firing a low effort into the bottom-right corner. Gakpo takes his World Cup tally to three goals as Klaassen works an offload inside for his run on the edge of the box. He takes a good touch before steering his effort on the stretch past Barsham.
