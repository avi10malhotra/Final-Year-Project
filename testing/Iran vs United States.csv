Iran threw everything they had at the USA, but the Americans overall had more quality and deserved the win. They particularily dominated in the first half, and were able to find their sole goal in the 38th minute through Pulisic. Iran looked a much better side in the second half, with Rezaeian especially showing a lot of quality on the right-hand side, but they ultimately could not get a chance past Turner.
38'	GOOOOAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLL!!!!! You can't say it hasn't been coming. The USA have been all over Iran, and they have finally got the ball in the back of the net. McKennie with a good ball to Dest, who heads it into the path of America's star man Pulisic to score. Iran 0-1 United States!
