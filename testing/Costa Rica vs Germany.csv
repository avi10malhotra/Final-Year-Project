Germany are out of the World Cup despite coming from behind to beat Costa Rica thanks to a brace from substitute Havertz. Ahead early on through a Gnabry header, Costa Rica turned the score in their favour in the second half. First, it was Tejeda who slammed the ball into the bottom corner, getting on the end of a rebound after Neuer fumbled Waston’s header. Suarez’s side briefly moved above Spain and into second when Vargas' flick was directed into the net by Neuer, before Havertz hit back with a quick response. Germany were behind for just three minutes, with the Chelsea man directing Fullkrug’s pass beyond Navas before slamming Gnabry’s inviting cross past the Costa Rican goalkeeper. With an assist to his name, Fullkrug then scored Germany’s fourth to confirm the victory, striking the ball in from close range after Sane laid it into his path. It was first disallowed for offside before VAR intervened to give the goal.
89'	GOAALLLL! FULLKRUG SCORES! 4-2 GERMANY! Germany score again, but they are still out as things stand. After a VAR check, Fullkrug is deemed to be onside after latching onto Sane's pass. With the goal open, the striker puts it into an open net to score his second of the competition after doing so against Spain.
85'	GOAAALLLLLL! HAVERTZ SCORES AGAIN! 3-2 GERMANY! Gnabry curls an inviting cross from the right towards the back of the box. Arriving late, Havertz rushes onto the cross and slams it into the bottom corner past Navas. If Spain find an equaliser, Germany will be through as things stand.
73'	GOAALLLL! GERMANY SCORE! 2-2! Havertz comes on and makes an impact. He is one-on-one with Navas inside the box with the ball flicked into his path by Fullkrug. He keeps his composure, dinking it over Navas.
70'	GOAAALLLLLL! 2-1 COSTA RICA! All the substitutes are on the pitch for what could be one of the most historic goals in Costa Rica’s history! With the ball knocked in the air, Vargas gets a touch on it, flicking the ball against Neuer who directs it into his own net.
58'	GOAALL! COSTA RICA SCORE! 1-1! It’s gone from bad to worse for Germany. Waston races into the middle of the box, heading the ball straight at Neuer. The goalkeeper cannot keep it in his hands, with Tejeda rushing to the rebound and smashing it into the bottom corner.
10'	GOAAALLLL! GNABRY SCORES! 1-0 GERMANY! This time, Germany score. Musiala runs forward with the ball, sliding it down the left to Raum. Looking for men in the middle, Gnabry latches onto the cross, heading it into the corner past Navas. Gnabry did not celebrate, picking up the ball and running back to his own half. Germany may have to win by two goals to finish in the top two positions of Group E.
