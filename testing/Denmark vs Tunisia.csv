Denmark were denied a late penalty in an entertaining goalless draw with Tunisia in the opening match of Group D. Deep into stoppage time, referee Cesar Arturo Ramos was instructed to go to the monitor after the ball hit the hand of Meriah, but he decided not to give a spot-kick. It would have been harsh on Tunisia, who had the better of the chances. In the first half, Jebali had a goal disallowed for offside before being denied by Schmeichel. One-on-one with the former Leicester man, Jebaliâ€™s close-range chip was tipped wide by the goalkeeper. After a difficult opening 45 minutes, Denmark grew into the game. Given the captaincy, after Kjaer was substituted, Eriksen had an effort pushed wide before substitute Cornelius had a glorious opportunity. The ball was headed towards him by Christensen but he hit the post with the goal gaping. Running towards it, he attempted to turn it in with his knee before using his head.
