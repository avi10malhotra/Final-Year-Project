Croatia are through to the World Cup semi-finals for the second tournament in a row courtesy of a 4-2 victory over Brazil on penalties after their quarter-final clash finished 1-1. Neymar looked to have put the Selecao on the path to the last four with a brilliant goal to break the deadlock in stoppage time in the first half of extra time. However, Bruno Petkovic equalised with a deflected effort to keep Croatia alive in the second half of extra time. Dominik Livakovic then performed his magic again to deny Rodrygo Silva from the penalty spot, while Zlatko Dalic's men were perfect piling the pressure on Marquinhos to score. The defender struck the post with a vital kick, sending Croatia through and Brazil home yet again at the quarter-final stage.
117'	GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!! PETKOVIC LEVELS!!!!!!! 1-1!!!! Croatia keep their World Cup alive with a late goal courtesy of Petkovic as his left-footed strike takes a deflection and beats Alisson. Orsic collects down the left flank and drives into the inside-left channel. He picks out Petkovic in the middle, who sweeps a left-footed strike towards goal. It deflects off Marquinhos which takes it away from Alisson and into the bottom-left corner. What a huge moment for Croatia.
105+1'	GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!! NEYMAR BREAKS THE DEADLOCK!!!!! 1-0 BRAZIL!!!!!!! Neymar draws level with Pele's all-time goalscoring record for Brazil with a brilliant move and finish. He collects on the edge of the box and plays a one-two with Paqueta, who produces a sublime offload back to his team-mate. Neymar fends off a block and rounds Livakovic before smashing his effort into the back of the net.
