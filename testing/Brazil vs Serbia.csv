After several chances that were not taken in the first 45 minutes, Brazil came out after half-time and continued to put Serbia on the backfoot. The opener came in the 62nd minute, Richarlison taking advantage of the ball Vanja Milinkovic-Savic parried into his path, smashing it into the back of the net. Richarlison also scored Brazil's second, an impressive acrobatic volley in the 73rd minute to secure the win. Serbia were relatively toothless going forward, and were unable to test Brazil's backline.
73'	GOOOOOOAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!! BRAZIL 2-0 SERBIA! IT'S A BRACE FOR RICHARLISON! And what a goal it is! The ball comes into the box for the striker, and he takes one touch to bring the ball up, before scoring a fantastic bicycle kick volley! What a goal!!!!
62'	GOOOOAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLL! Brazil 1-0 Serbia! And the opener comes for Brazil from Richarlison. Neymar does well to evade several Serbian defenders in the box, and the ball is then taken by Vinicius, who takes a powerful shot from the left. It's saved, but the Spurs striker hits the rebound right into the back of the net.
