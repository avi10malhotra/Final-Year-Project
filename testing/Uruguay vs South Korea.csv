The first half was evenly contested with both sides having good spells throughout. South Korea started and ended the half well with their best chance coming in the 34th minute when Ui-Jo fired over the bar despite being uncontested inside the box. Godin almost scored against the run of play just before the break as his header from a corner crashed against the woodwork, Uruguay's best chance of the half. The second half was quiet for the most part, but it burst into life toward the end. Valverde hit the post with a long-range effort in the 90th minute before Son shot wide at the other end after a mistake from Rochet. Neither side could find a goal as the game finished 0-0.
