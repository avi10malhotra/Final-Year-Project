Senegal are through to the knockout stages for the first time since 2002 with a 2-1 win over Ecuador. Sarr won a penalty just before the break when Hincapie crashed into him, and he coolly stepped up to slot it home. Ecuador pushed after the break and equalised from a corner when Caicedo tapped in from close range, but just two and a half minutes later, Senegal took the lead again. Idrissa Gueye's free-kick deflected to Koulibaly and the captain volleyed in the winner to send his side through.
70'	KOULIBALY SCORES! And just like that, Senegal are back in front! Idrissa Gueye steps up to the free-kick he won and swings a wonderful delivery into the box. It bounces off Torres' shoulder and straight to Koulibaly. He's unmarked and fires a wonderful volley straight past Galindez. 2-1 Senegal!
67'	CAICEDO EQUALISES! It's a huge goal for Ecuador! It's a great delivery from Plata on the corner and Torres rises highest to flick it on in the middle of the crowded box. Caicedo is unmarked at the far post, and is being played onside by the man on the line, and he slots it into the back of the net. 1-1!
44'	SARR SCORES! It's cool as you like from the man that won the penalty! He takes a slow run-up to the spot, stuttering it as he stares down the goalkeeper. He coolly slots it into the bottom right corner, leaving Galindez static in the middle of his line. 1-0 Senegal!
