The full-time whistle goes, sealing England's passage to the quarter-finals of the World Cup! The Three Lions began the second half as they finished the first, scoring their third goal through Saka within 12 minutes of the restart. From then on, it was a case of keeping Senegal at arm's length, and England certainly did that, nearly adding to their lead on several occasions and restricting their opponents to the occasional pop-shot as they closed out a 3-0 victory, to set up a mouth-watering clash with France in the last eight.
57'	GOOOOOAAAALLL!!! England make it three!!! Kane looks to have lost the ball but Foden charges onto it, searing down the left wing. He dribbles to the byline and fires the ball across the face of goal, where Saka arrives at the front post to lift it over Mendy and into the back of the net!! That's three in the tournament for Saka, and just as many for England in this game as they make it 3-0!
45+3'	GOOOOOOAAAAALLLL!!!! What a move to double the lead!!! Bellingham latches onto a loose ball and sparks an England counter-attack. He strides through the middle before feeding Foden, who immediately passes to the unmarked Kane. The England captain was yet to score at this tournament, but he lashes the ball beyond a helpless Mendy to rattle the back of the net and put England 2-0 up right on half-time!
39'	GOOOOOOAAAAALLLL!!!! England strike first!!! Kane drops deep and releases Bellingham sprinting away in front. He draws several defenders before he cuts the ball back, and Henderson is on hand to slot it below Edouard Mendy and into the back of the net!!! They've hardly threatened so far, but just like that, England lead this knockout tie by a score of 1-0!
