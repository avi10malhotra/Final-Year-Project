France get their World Cup defence off to a winning start, easily beating Australia! Les Bleus got caught cold by Goodwin's early goal, the fastest at this World Cup so far, but weren't fazed as they then proceeded to score four goals without reply. Giroud will be pleased with his double, while Mbappe was magnificent as ever.
71'	GOAL! FRANCE 4-1 AUSTRALIA! Giroud grabs his second goal of the game, planting Mbappe's left-wing cross into the far bottom corner with his head. He's tied with Thierry Henry as France's top goalscorer!
68'	GOAL! FRANCE 3-1 AUSTRALIA! Mbappe has given France a two-goal cushion! The breakout star of the last World Cup stays in the box after a wayward cross. Dembele picks up the pieces and floats the ball back in for the PSG man to head in off the post.
32'	GOAL! FRANCE 2-1 AUSTRALIA! It's a simple but beautiful goal. Giroud peels off his marker in the centre of the box and fires Rabiot's cutback into an empty net. That's two goals in five minutes for France!
27'	GOAL! FRANCE 1-1 AUSTRALIA! France have equalised through Rabiot! Australia defend the corner but switch off in the second phase. Theo Hernandez swings the ball back into the box and Rabiot plants a header past Ryan!
9'	GOAL! FRANCE 0-1 AUSTRALIA! Souttar's crossfield pass is taken down by Leckie, who leaves Lucas Hernandez down on the turf. The winger fizzes a low cross to the far post where Goodwin arrives to arrow high into the net!
