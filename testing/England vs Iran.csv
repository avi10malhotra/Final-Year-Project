England open their World Cup campaign with a 6-2 win over Iran. The Three Lions were out of sight at half-time, taking a 3-0 lead into the break; Bellingham glanced in his first England goal before Saka and Sterling added to the tally. Saka got his second just after the hour mark before Taremi pulled one back when he fired one in off the underside of the bar. Rashford and Grealish both came off the bench to wrap it up, with the former scoring just 49 seconds after his introduction. A late penalty from Taremi after a foul by Stones finished off the game.
90+13'	TAREMI SCORES! The referee's whistle went, but Taremi was in no hurry to take the penalty as he stared Pickford down. He takes a couple of stuttering steps before striding to the ball and coolly slotting it into the bottom-right corner, sending the keeper the wrong way. 6-2!
90'	GREALISH SCORES! Bellingham slides a lovely throughball down the right and Wilson has space to run into. He cuts inside and it looks like he's setting up for a shot at the near post, but he unselfishly chooses to square it to Grealish instead, and he's left with a simple tap-in. 6-1 England!
71'	RASHFORD SCORES! He's only been on the pitch a matter of seconds! Kane slides it out to him on the right, and he takes it around Moharrami with his first touch since coming on to get into the box before sliding it past Hossein Hosseini and into the far bottom corner of the net. 5-1 England!
65'	TAREMI SCORES! Iran have pulled one back! Moharrami sees his cross blocked, but he keeps hold of it to play it into Gholizadeh. He spots Taremi's run off the back of Maguire and threads it through for him. He lets it run across him before firing his shot over Pickford and in off the bottom of the bar. 4-1!
62'	SAKA SCORES AGAIN! It starts with a poor clearance from Hossein Hosseini, and England punish him for it. Sterling rides the challenge from Kanani to knock it out to Saka on the right, and he cuts inside. He drags it past Majid Hosseini before curling it towards goal, and a deflection helps it past the keeper. 4-0 England!
45+1'	STERLING SCORES! Pickford goes long and Kane nods it down before Bellingham surges upfield before returning it to the forward. He squares a dangerous low cross into the near post and puts it on a plate for Sterling, who fires it past Hossein Hosseini. 3-0 England!
43'	SAKA SCORES! Yet again, England look for Maguire from a corner, and Trippier picks him out again. He peels to the back of the back and nods it down for Saka. He lets it bounce in front of him before putting his laces through it first-time on the volley. It flies through the crowd and into the top corner. 2-0 England!
35'	BELLINGHAM SCORES! England do manage to work some space down the left and Shaw loops a cross into the box. Bellingham is unmarked on the penalty spot and he helps it on, leaving Hossein Hosseini stranded as it nestles into the back of the net for his first England goal. 1-0 England!
