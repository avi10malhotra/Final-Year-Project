GOOOOOOAAAAALLLL!!!! Can you believe it???? Itakura's long ball from a free-kick in his own half is met by Asano, who beats Schlotterbeck with a beauty of a first touch. He darts into the box and smashes a shot from the tightest of angles, which beats Neuer and flies into the roof of the net!!! What a turnaround, what a story, and what a finish, to put Japan 2-1 up!!!
75'	GOOOOAAAALLLL!!!!! Japan have parity, and boy do they deserve it!!! Mitoma drives forward before feeding Minamino, whose ball across the face is parried away by Neuer. Doan reacts quickest to smash the ball into the back of the net, and the three Japan substitutes combine to put them back on level terms at 1-1!
33'	GOOOAAALLL!!! Germany lead!!! Gundogan finally has success in the box as he steps up to take the penalty, sends Gonda the wrong way, and slots the ball into the left-hand corner to put Germany 1-0 up! A needless penalty to concede from Japan's point of view, and after a bright start, the Samurai Blues trail!
