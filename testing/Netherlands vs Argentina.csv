It's all over, and Argentina squeeze their way home as they progress to the last four! The Oranje's late comeback, and the two goals from Wout Weghorst right at the very end looked to have swung momentum in their favour, but couldn't find another in the half-hour of extra time. Penalties inevitably came, and two wonderful Emi Martinez saves gave his side the advantage, with the Albiceleste edging a 4-3 victory in the shoot-out to set up a semi-final showdown with Croatia.
90+11'	GOOOOOOOOAAAAAALLLLL!!!!!!!! They have done it!!!! Shaping to shoot, Koopmeiners instead rolls the ball right next to the wall, where Weghorst takes a touch before slotting the ball into the bottom corner to make it 2-2!!! What drama in Lusail, and we're locked up and level with just seconds to play!
83'	GOOOOAAALLL!!! Hang on a moment!!! Berghuis curls a belter of a cross from deep and Weghorst races to the front post. His flicked, glancing header is an absolute peach, and bounces beyond Emi Martinez into the far corner! 2-1, and the Dutch are certainly back in this one now!
73'	GOOOAAALLL!!!! Argentina double their lead!!! Messi steps up with all the calmness and composure we've come to expect, and buries his penalty right into the corner. Noppert is rooted to the spot, but Argentina certainly aren't, as they've got at least one foot in the semi-finals now!
35'	GOOOOOAAAAALLL!!!!! There is the breakthrough for the Albiceleste!!! Messi drops a shoulder and darts through midfield, before threading a pass through the eye of a needle into the box. Molina latches onto it and steps beyond Blind, before stabbing the ball beyond Noppert to put Argentina 1-0 up!!! That's what we've been waiting for!
