Croatia advance to the World Cup round of 16 at the expense of Belgium after playing out a goalless draw in their Group F clash. Neither team could force a breakthough, but Romelu Lukaku missed four great openings that could have saved the Red Devils from a premature exit from the competition. Lukaku struck the post and missed from close range on a frustrating night for the forward after he was introduced at half-time. Croatia held firm at the back to secure the goalless draw to advance in second place ahead of Belgium, while Morocco finish top of Group F as a result of their win over Canada.
