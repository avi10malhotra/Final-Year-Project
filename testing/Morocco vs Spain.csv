Morocco qualified for the quarter-finals of the World Cup for the first time after beating Spain on penalties. Stuck in their third for most of the game, they went close through Aguerd in the first half before surviving an onslaught. Having just one shot in the second half, Bounou pushed away Olmo’s powerful effort before Morata missed the target with a header. In extra-time, Simon made a point-blank save from Cheddira before Sarabia hit the post with the final kick to send the match to penalties. Spain faltered from the spot, failing to score any of their three penalties. Sarabia hit the post with Bounou saving spot-kicks from Soler and Busquets. Morocco were cool from 12 yards. Simon saved Benoun's effort, but composed strikes from Sabiri and Ziyech, and a chip from Hakimi sent Regragui’s side through.
