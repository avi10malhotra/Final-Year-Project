France advance to their second World Cup final in a row courtesy of a 2-0 win over Morocco in their semi-final clash. Theo Hernandez put Les Bleus in front in the fifth minute with a close-range finish after Kylian Mbappe's effort was blocked. France spurned opportunities to double their advantage, which gave Morocco hope as Jawad El Yamiq struck the post. However, Didier Deschamps' men remained strong at the back and duly notched their second to wrap up the contest through substitute Randal Kolo Muani, who scored his first international goal to send his team into the final.
79'	GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!! KOLO MUANI CONVERTS AT THE BACK POST!!!!! 2-0 FRANCE!!!!!! Kolo Muani scores his first international goal with his first touch in the game to surely send France back to the World Cup final. Mbappe causes havoc in the final third as he twists and turns to fire towards goal. His effort is charged down, but the rebound falls kindly for Kolo Muani to steer the ball past Bounou from six yards. What a time to get your first goal!
5'	GOALLLLLLL!!!!!!!! HERNANDEZ FIRES FRANCE AHEAD!!!! 1-0!!! Les Bleus take the lead as Hernandez holds his composure from close range to beat Bounou. France cut Morocco open down the inside-right channel as Varane releases Griezmann. He offloads back to Mbappe, who sees two strikes blocked. However, the rebound from his second effort falls kindly for Hernandez to score with a fine finish.
