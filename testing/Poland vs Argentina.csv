It's all over at Stadium 974, and Argentina are through to the last 16! The South Americans have thoroughly dismantled Poland to do it. Mac Allister and Alvarez got the goals, but they should have had more after Messi had a penalty saved in the first half. Poland will be mightily relieved they didn't.
67'	GOAL! POLAND 0-2 ARGENTINA! Alvarez doubles Argentina's lead and leaves Poland in deep trouble! The Manchester City man controls Fernandez's pass and holds off his man in the box to send a stunning strike past Szczesny.
46'	GOAL! POLAND 0-1 ARGENTINA! Argentina have the lead they deserve, seconds after the restart! Mac Allister converts Molina's cross, finding the bottom left corner from the centre of the box.
