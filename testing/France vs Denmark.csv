A brace from Mbappe earns all three points for France, who edge past Denmark 2-1 at Stadium 974. After a first half that had promise but lacked clinical finishing, the two sides shifted into life after the restart with both teams confident in their ability to win the match. Mbappe gave his nation the lead just after the hour, linking up with Hernandez during a counter-attack before beating Schmeichel with a close-range shot but Hjulmand’s team were not to be denied - equalising seven minutes later. Eriksen’s corner found its intended target, with Andersen’s flick-on supplying Christensen with the chance to beat Lloris. The result would be decided four minutes from time though, with the PSG forward latching onto Griezmann’s cross to turn the ball over the line. The win guarantees France’s passage to the knockouts, while Denmark must beat Australia on the final day.

68'	DENMARK PULL LEVEL! 1-1! It’s a typically dangerous corner-kick from Eriksen, who puts his delivery right into the path of Andersen. The Crystal Palace centre-back manages to nod it across the face of goal to Christensen, who powers his header past Lloris!
61'	FRANCE TAKE THE LEAD! 1-0! Hernandez charges up the pitch on the left side before feeding it to Mbappe, who carries the ball confidently to the edge of the area. The Milan left-back continues his run and provides an option for a one-two pass that allows Mbappe to dispatch a tricky shot that beats Schmeichel!
