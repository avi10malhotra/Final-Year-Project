Putting on a comprehensive performance today, England stroll through to the knockout stages; seeing off the challenge of neighbours Wales, who exit the finals with a muted display. A brilliant brace from Rashford, plus Foden's direct approach - and goal - helped the Three Lions overcome limited opponents, who are now surely at the end of their golden era. Southgate's side roll on to the last 16 as Group B winners; Wales finish fourth.
68'	ENGLAND STRIKE AGAIN! The Three Lions have their 100th World Cup finals goal! Phillips flips a ball over the top to pick out Rashford on the right, and the Manchester United man steps inside three limp challenges to power a low shot at Ward, who can only deflect the ball into the net! It's 3-0 to England, and they can make plans for the last 16!
51'	FODEN STRIKES! Faced by sluggish defending from an experienced Wales defence, Kane pulls away on the right side of the area and crosses low across the six-yard box for Foden, who arrives at the back post. Without breaking stride, the latter guides the ball into an unguarded net; putting England two goals to the good!!
50'	ENGLAND LEAD! The Three Lions take the lead! From a 20-yard free-kick, situated on the left side of the area, Rashford sidefoots a dipping shot powerfully past Ward and into the top-right corner! Wales 0-1 England!!
