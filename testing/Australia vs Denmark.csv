The first half was largely controlled by Denmark but still fairly quiet in both boxes. Ryan was forced into a stop after Souttar turned Maehleâ€™s cross toward his own goal, but the goalkeeper reacted well to save with his feet. Australia did manage three shots on target in the first period, but all the attempts were tame and comfortable for Schmeichel to save. Australia started the second period well and were rewarded as Leckie put them in the lead in the 60th minute. He ran 40 yards before nutmegging Maehle on his on way to finding the bottom right corner. Denmark were poor in the second half and could not trouble Ryan at all as Australia win 1-0 to progress to the knockout rounds.
60'	GOALLL!! 1-0 AUSTRALIA! LECKIE! Leckie scores a wonderful solo goal to give Australia the lead! He sends Maehle the wrong way twice before putting the ball through his legs and into the bottom right corner.
