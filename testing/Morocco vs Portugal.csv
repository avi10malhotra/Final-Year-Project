History is written, as Morocco become Africa's first World Cup semi-finalists by bravely beating Portugal in Al Thumama. Defending relentlessly and exhibiting great skill on the break, the Atlas Lions roar into the final four thanks to En-Nesyri's magnificent first-half header. Even with several injuries to contend with, they delight their hordes of noisy fans, and having eliminated Belgium, Spain and now Portugal, a high-stakes clash with England or France awaits.
42'	MOROCCO LEAD! At the third time of asking, En-Nesyri strikes! Having missed two earlier headed chances, the Sevilla striker leaps brilliantly to beat Costa to a cross from the left by Attiyat-Allah. He nods the ball into the back of the unguarded net; putting the Atlas Lions 1-0 ahead just before the break!
