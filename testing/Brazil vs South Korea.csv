Quite an incredible performance from Brazil. An absolutely dominant first half put the game to bed by the half-time whistle - goals from Vinicius, Neymar, Richarlison and Paqueta ensured that they had the cushion of a four-goal lead heading into the interval. They took their foot off the gas in the second half and Korea Republic even managed to score a consolation goal through Seung-Ho Paik. But it was too little, too late.
76'	GOAL! Seung-Ho Paik pulls one back for Korea Republic to make it 4-1. The ball is whipped in from a free-kick and cleared as far as Paik at the edge of the area. He takes a touch and unleashes a fine half-volley that arrows past Alisson and hits the back of the net.
36'	GOAL! Paqueta makes it 4-0. Richarlison carries the ball forward from deep before finding Neymar, who in turn plays in Vinicius. He then pulled the ball back across the face of goal for the oncoming Paqueta, who finishes superbly.
29'	GOAL! Richarlison scores to make it 3-0 to Brazil. He shows amazing skill to beat his man before passing to Marquinhos, who in turn plays the ball to Thiago Silva. He then plays through Richarlison, who finishes clinically to increase his team's lead.
13'	GOAL! Neymar makes it 2-0 with a ice-cold penalty. He rolls his effort into the bottom right corner of the back of the neat with real ease.
7'	GOAL! Vinicius makes it 1-0 to Brazil. Raphinha does superb work down the right flank before pulling it back across goal for Vinicius at the back post. He takes a touch, steadies himself and then puts the ball into the top right corner of the back of the net.
