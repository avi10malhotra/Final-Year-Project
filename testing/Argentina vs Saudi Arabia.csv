Argentina took the lead in the 10th minute as they were awarded a penalty after the referee saw a foul on Paredes on the VAR monitor. Messi rolled the spot kick past Al Owais, who dived the wrong way. The South American team put the ball in the net a further three times in the half, twice by Martinez and once by Messi, but they were all disallowed for offside. Saudi Arabia could not manage a shot in the first 45 minutes but they scored with both of their shots on target in the second half. Al Shehri equalised in the 48th minute after scoring via a deflection from Romero before Al Dawsari scored a stunning curler put Saudi Arabia in the lead. Al Owais made five saves in the game while substitute Al Amri cleared the ball off the line in the 92nd minute to secure a 2-1 win for his side.
