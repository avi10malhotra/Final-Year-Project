France advance to the quarter-finals of the World Cup courtesy of a 3-1 win over Poland in their round-of-16 clash. Olivier Giroud opened the scoring with a record-breaking 52nd goal for Les Bleus, taking him beyond Thierry Henry as France's all-time leading goalscorer. Kylian Mbappe displayed his brilliance to steer his team through with two superb strikes to take his tally of goals to five at the tournament. Robert Lewandowski got a consolation at the death for Poland from the penalty spot, but their World Cup has now ended.
90+9'	GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!! LEWANDOWSKI CONVERTS!!!! 3-1!!! Lewandowski scores with his second effort to end his tournament with a consolation goal. He does a stutter-step as he did with his first attempt, but on this occasion he fires his effort into the bottom-left corner.
90+1'	GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!! MBAPPE SCORES ANOTHER STUNNER!!!! 3-0!!!!! Mbappe ensures that France are heading into the quarter-finals in style with another brilliant finish. Thuram slides a pass inside for the forward, who takes a touch out of his feet before smashing a right-footed strike into the top-right corner. A special goal.
74'	WHAT A GOAL!! MBAPPE FIRES IN A SECOND FOR FRANCE!!!!! 2-0!!! Les Bleus are surely heading into the last eight as Mbappe rifles a strike into the top-left corner. France clear their lines at one end before Giroud releases Dembele on the counter. The winger cuts inside from the right flank and feeds Mbappe in space. Mbappe takes a touch and hammers a right-footed strike past Szczesny.
44'	GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!! GIROUD FIRES FRANCE IN FRONT!!!!! 1-0!!!!! Giroud becomes France's record goalscorer as he places a left-footed strike past Szczesny to put Les Bleus ahead. Mbappe slides a throughball into the path of Giroud in the box as he gains a step on Kiwior. The forward shoots on the turn and has the placement to find the bottom-right corner. What a moment for Giroud and France.
