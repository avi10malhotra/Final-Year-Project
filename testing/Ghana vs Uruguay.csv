Uruguay and Ghana are both knocked out of the World Cup, despite a 2-0 win for Uruguay. Andre Ayew had the chance to give Ghana the lead from the spot after VAR awarded a penalty for a late challenge by Rochet, but his tame effort was saved. Two goals in six minutes from De Arrascaeta then put Uruguay in the driving seat and they were heading into the last 16 until a late goal for South Korea in the other game gave them a win. Uruguay were denied a penalty by VAR, and no matter how hard both sides pushed, they couldn't find the back of the net in stoppage time.
32'	DE ARRASCAETA SCORES AGAIN! It's a lovely goal from Uruguay. Pellistri lifts it up and Nunez nods it on so that Suarez can help it onto De Arrascaeta. He has a quick glance up and fizzes his low shot towards goal. It sneaks under Ati-Zigi and into the back of the net. 2-0 Uruguay!
26'	DE ARRASCAETA SCORES! Uruguay have their first goal in this World Cup! He starts the move by winning it on the halfway line and Pellistri swings a cross in from the right. Suarez's low shot is saved by Ati-Zigi, but it bounces over his arms and De Arrascaeta nods it in at the far post. 1-0 Uruguay!
