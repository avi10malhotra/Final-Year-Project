Portugal get off the mark at the World Cup with a dramatic 3-2 victory over Ghana at the 974 Stadium. After a goalless first half, Cristiano Ronaldo opened the scoring with a controversial penalty to become the first man to score at five World Cups. Andre Ayew equalised for the Black Stars, but Joao Felix and Rafael Leao scored their first World Cup goals to put the Selecao in command. Osman Bukari made it a tense finish with a close-range header and Diogo Costa almost handed Inaki Williams a stoppage-time equaliser only for the forward to slip at the vital moment. Fernando Santos' men held on to secure the three points to get up and running in Group H.
89'	GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!! BUKARI GETS ANOTHER ONE BACK FOR GHANA!!!!!! 3-2!!! The Black Stars are not out of this game yet as Bukari steers home a header into the top-right corner. Rahman runs down the left flank and gets the better of Cancelo before he lifts a cross to the back post. It takes a deflection to reach Bukari and he makes no mistake with a perfect header to beat Costa.
80'	GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!! LEAO STEERS HOME A STRIKE!!!!!! 3-1 PORTUGAL!!!! Portugal take command of the game as Leao curls home a fine strike from the inside-left channel for his first international goal. Fernandes times his offload to perfection to release Leao in space. The forward takes the effort on first-time and guides it away from Ati-Zigi into the bottom-right corner.
78'	GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!! JOAO FELIX RESTORES PORTUGAL'S LEAD!!!!! 2-1!!!!!! The Selecao regain the lead as Joao Felix races on to a throughball and slots his effort over Ati-Zigi into the net. Fernandes threads the needle to release Joao Felix in the inside-right channel. The forward still has work to do, but he guides his strike past the on-rushing keeper to put his team back in front. A cool finish from Joao Felix.
73'	GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!! AYEW POKES HOME AN EQUALISER!!!! 1-1!!!! Ghana are back in the game as Ayew converts from close range. Kudus makes a great run behind the Portugal defence down the inside-left channel. He puts in a sublime low cross into the middle that Ayew attacks and steers home with his right boot in the six-yard area. Game on.
65'	GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!! RONALDO FIRES PORTUGAL AHEAD!!!! 1-0!!!! The forward holds his composure from the penalty spot as he hammers his right-footed strike up and above Ati-Zigi's dive and into the back of the net. You can never keep Ronaldo down for long as he becomes the first man to score a five World Cups.
