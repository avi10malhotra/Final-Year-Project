Australia secure their first victory at a World Cup since 2010 by beating Tunisia 1-0 to give their hopes of reaching the last 16 a huge boost. Mitchell Duke scored the only goal of the game with a precise header from Craig Goodwin's cross. Tunisia pressed and threatened briefly through efforts from Youssef Msakni, but the Socceroos were resolute at the back, led by Harry Souttar, to hold out for the three points.
23'	GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!!! DUKE HEADS AUSTRALIA IN FRONT!!!!!! 1-0!!!!! The Socceroos take the lead as Duke glances a header beyond the reach of Dahmen. Goodwin raids down the left flank and drills a cross into the middle. It takes a deflection and falls perfectly for Duke to flick his header into the right corner away from the despairing dive of the Tunisia keeper. A huge goal for Australia.
