All over and both Japan and Spain progress to the Round of 16. Spain took the lead in the first half through Morata only for Japan to mount a dramatic comeback in the second half following goals from Doan and Tanaka. That, coupled with the fact that Germany beat Costa Rica in the group's other game, means that Japan go through as group winners while Spain go through as runners-up.
51'	GOAL! Tanaka scores to fire Japan into the lead. Doan did superbly to square the ball across the face of goal to find Mitoma, who did well to cut the ball back to Tanaka, who managed to bundle the ball over the line and make it 2-1.
48'	GOAL! Doan gets Japan back on level terms. The substitute, just on the pitch, seizes the ball at the edge of the box after sloppy defending by Spain before unleashing a fine effort into the top corner of the net, too much power on the shot for Simon to save it.
11'	GOAL! Morata makes it 1-0 to Spain. The forward arrows a fine header past Gonda after Azpilicueta floats in an inch-perfect cross from the right side.
