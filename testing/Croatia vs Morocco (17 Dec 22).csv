Croatia finish third in the World Cup after a 2-1 win over Morocco! It took Croatia just seven minutes to break the deadlock as Gvardiol scored a brilliant diving header, but they were pegged back less than two minutes later when Dari nodded in from close range. Orsic restored their lead not long before half-time with a lovely effort that curled in off the far post. Morocco had two big chances in the second half to try and take it to extra time, but Livakovic made himself big to deny En-Nesyri before the forward thumped a header over in the final seconds.
42'	ORSIC SCORES! And what a goal it is! Majer's heavy touch takes away his chance for a shot, but Croatia keep hold of the ball as Livaja knocks it out to Orsic. On the left of the box, he hits it first time, curling his shot just over Bounou's outstretched hand and in off the inside of the far post. 2-1 Croatia!
9'	DARI EQUALISES! Just like that, Morocco are back in this game! Croatia's goalscorer, Gvardiol, gives away the free-kick and it's not a great delivery from Ziyech, but it loops off Majer in the wall and onto the edge of the six-yard box. Dari is alert and he heads it past Livakovic from close range. 1-1!
7'	GVARDIOL SCORES! It's a lovely free-kick from Modric as he lifts it into the near post and Perisic peels away from his defender to cushion it into the middle. Gvardiol throws himself forward to head the ball past Bounou as it sneaks into the back of the net. 1-0 Croatia!
