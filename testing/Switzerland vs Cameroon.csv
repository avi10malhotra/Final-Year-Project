Embolo scored the only goal of the game to get Switzerland off to a winning start in Group G. Second-best in the first half, the Swiss scored three minutes after the break. Xhaka started the move, sliding the ball down the right to Shaqiri who picked out Embolo in the middle of the box. Unmarked, the striker lashed the ball past Onana who had no chance. Switzerland could have scored a second through a similar move. This time it was Vargas who had the scoring opportunity, but the Inter goalkeeper pushed his attempt wide. Tired in the second 45 minutes, Cameroon should have taken the lead in the first. Mbeumo ignored Choupo-Moting in the middle of the box, lashing a shot from the left straight at Sommer before the Switzerland goalkeeper pushed away Hongla’s attempt later in the half.
