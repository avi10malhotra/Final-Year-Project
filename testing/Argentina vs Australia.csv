A goal in each half for Argentina prevented a late Australia surge from coming to fruition, sealing a 2-1 nervy but deserved victory. Despite few chances for either side in the first half, Messi capped his 1,000th game for club and country with his first World Cup knockout goal, finishing in clinical fashion following a free-kick that wasn’t adequately cleared. Alvarez’s strike three minutes before the hour looked to wrap up the result, but a late Goodwin strike - deemed an own goal thanks to Fernandez’s deflection - made it anything but easy in the end. Scaloni’s side would ultimately see out the remainder of the game without adding to their lead despite promising opportunities in injury time, but hung on to book their fourth quarter-final trip in the last five World Cups.
57'	ALVAREZ DOUBLES ARGENTINA’S LEAD! 2-0! Argentina’s pressing pays dividends, with the midfield stepping up immediately to try and win the ball back following Ryan’s throw. A poor pass back from Rowles puts the goalkeeper under pressure inside his area and allows Alvarez to steal it back and slot into an empty net!
35'	A GOAL FOR MESSI IN GAME NUMBER 1,000! 1-0 ARGENTINA! Messi’s initial free-kick into the six-yard box is repelled by Souttar, but the Albiceleste regain possession and look to hit from a central position in the second phase. Mac Allister plays a pass into Otamendi, whose first touch tees Messi up for a shot expertly and the captain meets it with a sweet hit into the bottom-left corner to beat Ryan!
