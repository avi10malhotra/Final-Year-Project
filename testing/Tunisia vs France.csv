It's all over, and despite Australia's win over Denmark putting paid to their chances of reaching the last 16, Tunisia hold on to record an historic victory over the world champions! The Eagles of Carthage secured their breakthrough, and their first goal of the tournament, thanks to Wahbi Khazri's wonderful strike. France piled on the pressure thereafter, and Antoine Griezmann thought he had scored a late equaliser, but VAR put paid to his efforts. Tunisia secure a victory which does not send them through, but will be long remembered in the annuls of Tunisian football.
58'	GOOOOOOAAAAALLLL!!!!! Tunisia have their goal!!! It's their first strike of this World Cup finals, and what a way, and what a time, to get it!!! Tunisia win the ball again and Laidouni plays it forward to Khazri. He turns and glides towards goal, stepping beyond two defenders before slotting the ball into the far corner of Mandanda's goal! 1-0 to Tunisia, and as it stands, that goal will be enough to send them into the last 16!
