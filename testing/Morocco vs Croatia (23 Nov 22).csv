It finishes goalless between Morocco and Croatia. There wasn't much to split the sides, with both of them having just two shots on target each in the game. Croatia had the better of the first-half chances, with Perisic and Modric firing over and Vlasic forcing a good save out of Bounou. After the break, Mazraoui saw a diving header pushed away before Livakovic denied Hakimi's powerful long-range strike.
