Portugal took the lead after just five minutes after Horta found the back of the net on his World Cup debut. South Korea equalised 20 minutes later after Kim Young-gwon reacted quickest to a mistake from Ronaldo. The first half was played at a very slow pace with both sides being very patient with their build-up play. Portugal were the more dominant side however, forcing Kim Seung-gyu into five saves. The second half was relatively quiet for the most part until Son Heung-min countered forward and Hwang Hee-chan scored the winner in the 91st minute to put South Korea through to the knockout rounds.
