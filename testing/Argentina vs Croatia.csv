With what was ultimately a comfortable victory, Argentina sweep into the World Cup final by seizing a crucial two-goal advantage during a few short minutes in the first half. Some vintage Messi magic opened up Croatia again after the interval; allowing partner Alvarez to strike once more, and the Albiceleste are set to feature in another global final - only eight years after their last. Led by Modric - who was somewhat subdued today - the Croatians bow out after yet another spirited run to the latter stages, and they are consigned to contesting third place at the weekend.
69'	ALVAREZ AGAIN! 3-0! Argentina are heading to the World Cup final! Messi dazzles Gvardiol on the right, hanging determinedly onto the ball before weaving his way to the byline. The fleet-footed maestro defeats his man again for good measure, before slotting the ball into the path of Alvarez, who merely slots home from close range!
39'	ALVAREZ STRIKES! Argentina go 2-0 ahead, through the sheer persistence of Alvarez! Released by Messi on the halfway line, the young striker charges through the centre, leaving a trail of defenders in his wake, then benefits from a couple of fortunate deflections before poking the ball home from close range!
34'	ARGENTINA LEAD! Messi is the man for the big moment again, as the Argentina skipper steps up to the spot and sweeps his penalty into the top-right corner, evading the despairing dive of Livakovic! There was no stopping that! The South American champions lead 1-0 in this World Cup semi-final!
