South Korea started the game well and looked more likely to score before Salisu broke the deadlock for Ghana in the 24th minute. Jordan Ayew sent in a dangerous free-kick into the six-yard box and South Korea failed to clear their lines. Salisu was quickest to react to the loose ball and fired home. Kudus then doubled Ghana's lead with a glancing header, once again from a Jordan Ayew cross. South Korea mounted a comeback early in the second half. Cho scored two headers either side of the hour mark, but they were only level for seven minutes as Kudus secured his own brace with a great finish past Kim Seung-gyu. South Korea tried to get a third but to no avail, as Ghana take all three points with a 3-2 win.
