Magnificent Morocco can enjoy their moment! The North Africans have fully merited this victory over a stilted Belgium side. The Atlas Lions were defensively resolute and scored through Sabiri's free-kick as the Belgians failed to learn from Ziyech's ruled-out goal. The Red Devils froze, and Aboukhlal picked them off to seal a famous win.
90+2'	GOAL! BELGIUM 0-2 MOROCCO! Aboukhlal seals the three points for Morocco! Belgium don't deal with Munir's goal-kick, and the Toulouse forward fires into the roof of the net from Ziyech's cutback!
73'	GOAL! BELGIUM 0-1 MOROCCO! Sabiri gives Morocco the lead with a carbon-copy free-kick to Ziyech's earlier, except from the opposite side! Again, the North Africans crowd out Courtois, but there's no offside this time!
