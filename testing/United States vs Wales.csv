A typical game of two halves ends in a 1-1 draw, after the US dominated the first half with a livewire display and Wales fought back via a more direct approach after the interval. Both teams take a point from their opening Group B fixture, but given the circumstances, Wales will be more pleased with salvaging something from an encounter they simply couldn't get a foothold in during the first 45. Once again, Bale is the Welsh saviour as the Dragons roar back late on.
82'	WALES EQUALISE!!! Bale bails Cymru out again! After winning the penalty himself, Wales' veteran skipper steps up to handle the pressure and drives his spot-kick into the top of the net via fingertip from Turner. It was a brave effort to keep the ball out, but Bale applied too much power! It's 1-1!
36'	USA LEAD! It's been coming! Sargent and Pulisic combine quickly just inside the Wales half, and the latter loses little time in spotting space to thread a low ball through to Weah. The US striker latches onto the ball with glee just outside the box, and takes just one strides before sliding the ball home past Hennessey to open the scoring! USA 1-0 WALES!
