Poland pick up three points to put themselves in pole position to progress to the Round of 16 ahead of the final game of the group phase. Saudi Arabia played well but goals from Zielinski and Lewandowski made the difference, ultimately, as did Al Dawsari's failure to convert his penalty. A competent performance from them.
82'	GOAL! Lewandowski scores his first-ever World Cup goal to make it 2-0 to Poland. Al Malki is caught dwelling on the ball in a dangerous area and Lewandowski picks his pocket before finishing clinically.
39'	GOAL! Zielinski makes it 1-0 to Poland. The ball falls to Lewandowski after a direct pass caught Saudi Arabia short and Zielinski finishes confidently after Lewandowski squares it to him.
