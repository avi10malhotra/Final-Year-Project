GOOOOAAAALLL!!! There's the finishing touch!!! Depay is one-on-one with Koulibaly and steps beyond him before shooting early. Mendy gets down to the effort, but can only parry it straight into the path of Klaassen, who arrives late to slot the ball into the empty net! A late flurry from the Dutch has seen them pull away from Senegal, and they'll end the game with a 2-0 victory!
84'	GOOOOAAAALLL!!!! Deadlock, broken!!! De Jong whips a peach of a ball into the box, and Gakpo darts in behind the defence, beats Mendy to the ball, and heads it straight into the top corner!! What anticipation, and what a finish from the highly sought-after forward, and with just minutes left to play, the Dutch have a 1-0 lead!
