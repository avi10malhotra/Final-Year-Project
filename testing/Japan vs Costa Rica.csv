A remarkable change of fortunes for both nations sees Costa Rica - thrashed by Spain in their opener - turn over Germany's conquerors Japan; scoring the winning goal late on, via their first shot on target of the tournament. After an admirable defensive display, Los Ticos made the most of an ineffective Japanese attack to absorb some second-half pressure and strike on the counter. Fuller's finish in the 81st minute sees the team which only squeezed into the finals with a playoff win over New Zealand move level on points with both Japan and Group E leaders Spain.
81'	COSTA RICA LEAD! Incredibly, Costa Rica's first shot on target in the Qatar World Cup results in what could be a winning goal!! After Japan lose the ball, Fuller receives it from Tejeda on the brink of the box, then coolly curls the ball into the back of the net via Gonda's outstretched fingertips! Costa Rica 1-0 Japan!
