Aboubakar came off the bench to score and assist for Cameroon who came from two goals behind to draw with Serbia in a World Cup classic. It was Cameroon who opened the scoring after Mitrovic missed two opportunities, with Castelletto latching onto Tolo’s corner. However, Serbia bounced back, heading into the break with the lead after two goals in first half stoppage time. Pavlovic scored the equaliser, directing Tadic’s free-kick past Epassy before Milinkovic-Savic curled his effort into the bottom corner. Struggling after going behind, Serbia looked to have claimed all three points when Mitrovic finished off a stunning move before Song made a change. Replacing Hongla with Aboubakar, the extra striker made the difference. Getting a goal back with a delicate chip, with the 30-year-old given the goal after a VAR check, the substitute then set up the leveller two minutes later. On the right, he cut the ball to Choupo-Moting, who couldn’t have had an easier finish.

Cutting inside, the winger then slides it to Mitrovic who puts it in from close range.
