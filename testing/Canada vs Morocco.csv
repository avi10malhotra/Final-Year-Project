Thanks to some clinical finishing and typically steadfast defending, Morocco win a second successive game at Qatar 2022 and reach the World Cup's knockout phase for the first time since 1986. Though they were forced back by an improved Canada side after the interval, the Atlas Lions top their group and become the second African nation to progress. They will now be paired up with a side from Group E, possibly Spain or Germany, and their fearless approach may make them an opponent to be wary of.
23'	MOROCCO HAVE TWO! A simple throughball down the right flank by Hakimi somehow catches the Canadian defence flat-footed, and En-Nesyri doesn't miss a beat. Racing onto the ball past Miller, the quick-witted then fires it into the net past Borjan at the near post! Canada 0-2 Morocco, and the Atlas Lions have one foot in the last 16!
4'	MOROCCO LEAD! Taking advantage of a terrible mix-up in the Canada defence, Ziyech latches on to a loose ball on the edge of the area and deftly lofts the ball over Borjan, who is wildly out of position having just given possession away! What a gift for the Atlas Lions, who roar into an early lead: 1-0 to Morocco!
