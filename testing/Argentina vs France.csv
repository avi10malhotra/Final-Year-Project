ARGENTINA WIN THE WORLD CUP! It took penalties after an electric 3-3 draw, but Argentina win 4-2 in the shootout! Messi and Di Maria scored the first-half goals for Argentina before Mbappe's late brace took it to extra time. Messi thought he'd won it, but Mbappe penned them back again, getting his hat-trick from the spot. In the shootout, Martinez made a huge save before Tchouameni missed. Argentina scored all of theirs, with Montiel scoring the winner.
118'	MBAPPE SCORES! He's equalised again and scored a World Cup final hat-trick! He keeps his eyes on Emiliano Martinez the whole time, and he catches the keeper out. He goes the opposite way to his last spot-kick and fires it into the back of the net. 3-3!
108'	MESSI SCORES! France are all over the place at the back as Argentina knock it through them again. Lautaro Martinez fires his shot across goal, and Lloris parries it away. Messi is hovering just in front of him and touches it in. Upamecano clears it from behind the line, and after a quick VAR check for offside, the goal stands! 3-2 Argentina!
81'	MBAPPE EQUALISES! They've stunned Argentina! Coman wins the ball back on the halfway line and France quickly switch it out to the left side. Mbappe nods it to Thuram and when it comes back to him, he hits the volley across goal while off balance. Martinez gets a hand to it, but again, can't stop it from nestling in the corner. It's a great goal! 2-2!
80'	MBAPPE SCORES! France have pulled one back! It's a good penalty from Mbappe and gets a lot of power on the shot. Martinez dives the right way and makes slight contact with the ball, but he can't get enough on it to stop it from nestling in the bottom left corner. 2-1!
36'	DI MARIA SCORES! It's Upamecano that loses the ball this time, and Argentina break on a quick counter. Messi flicks it past his marker to pick out Mac Allister's run and he surges into the box before unselfishly squaring it to Di Maria. Lloris rushes out, but the winger's first-time shot beats him and nestles into the far bottom corner. 2-0 Argentina!
23'	MESSI SCORES! It's as cool as you like from the Argentina captain! He takes a short run-up to the spot, just hesitating in front of the ball as he looks up at Lloris. The keeper dives to his right and can only watch as the ball flies into the opposite corner. 1-0 Argentina!
