An impressively clinical performance from the Netherlands sees them through to the last eight of Qatar 2022, as they swat aside the challenge of a high-energy USA team. Soaking up some pressure at times, the Oranje used all of their experience - and that of their celebrated coach - to take advantage of the States' naivety and score three times, with the irrepressible Dumfries involved on each occasion. The first was a fluid footballing moment reminiscent of their famed Total Football, and though they were briefly tested by conceding a second-half goal, Van Gaal's men deservedly take their place in the quarter-finals.
81'	DUMFRIES DOES IT AGAIN! Surely putting his nation into the World Cup quarter-finals, Dumfries adds to his pair of assists by steering the Netherlands 3-1 up! Meeting Blind's precise cross from the left with a controlled volley on the opposite side of the box, the wing-back finds the bottom-left corner of Turner's goal!
76'	USA BACK IN IT! A first-time throughball by Yedlin - just on as a substitute - plays in Pulisic on the right, and his cutback from the byline loops up off Wright and spins over Noppert into the back of the net! Netherlands 2-1 USA, and there's all to play for now!
45+1'	DOUBLE DUTCH DELIGHT! Outwitting his marker on the right byline, following a throw-in, Dumfries unlocks the States' defence once again. The wing-back cuts the ball back for Blind - chasing in from the opposite flank - who slots the ball into the bottom corner for his side's second goal! Just before the break, it's Netherlands 2-0 USA!!
10'	THE NETHERLANDS LEAD! A brilliant sweeping move of one-touch passing and movement puts the Netherlands in front! At the end of a rhythmic passing sequence which slices through the US defence, Depay receives the ball from Dumfries on the edge of the area and buries it in the bottom-left corner! What a beauty! Netherlands 1-0 USA!
