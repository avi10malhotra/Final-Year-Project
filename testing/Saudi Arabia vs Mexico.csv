Heartbreak for Mexico as they are out of the World Cup despite a 2-1 win over Saudi Arabia. Mexico were on top from the first whistle and finally got their breakthrough just two minutes into the second half when Martin poked in from close range. Chavez then scored a truly outstanding long-range free-kick to make it 2-0. They needed a third to leapfrog Poland into second place, and Lozano and Antuna both had goals disallowed for tight offsides before Al Dawsari ended their hopes with a late consolation for Saudi Arabia.
90+5'	AL DAWSARI SCORES! And takes away Mexico's chance of reaching the last 16! Al Dawsari plays a lovely one-two with Bahbri on the edge of the box and he's one-on-one with Ochoa. He has a quick glance to check where the keeper is before slotting his shot into the near post. 2-1!
52'	WHAT A GOAL! Absolutely incredible! Chavez steps up to take the free-kick that Martin won, and it's a long way out, but that doesn't deter him! It's straight down the middle and he strikes it sweetly, lifting it over the wall and over the stretching Al Owais into the near post. 2-0 Mexico!
47'	MARTIN SCORES! What a start to the second half by Mexico! Their early pressure won them a corner and Chavez swings it into the box. It's flicked on at the near post by Montes and Martin is unmarked in the six-yard box to tap it past Al Owais from close range. 1-0 Mexico!
